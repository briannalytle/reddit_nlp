FAFSA/financial aid verification questions? Get help here!,"**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread. All standalone posts on these topics will be removed.**

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.gov) if you are [eligible to do so](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility).

2019-2020 school year: Use the 2019-2020 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2018. This one requires 2017 tax information.

2020-2021 school year: Use the 2020-2021 FAFSA, which opens October 1, 2019. This one requires 2018 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide to the financial aid process.**

1. Create an [FSA ID](http://www.fsaid.ed.gov). This is your legal electronic signature to sign your FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use their existing FSA ID.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the [IRS Data Retrieval Tool](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/resources/irs-drt-text), use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

I'm a moderator here on /r/college and an admissions and financial aid expert in the real world. These FAFSA help threads have been a pet project for many years and I enjoy helping you all, wherever you live. Ask away! *I will always respond.*",435,88,47.065376753335194,college

Best College Majors for People Who Don't Like Reading?,"Whenever I look that question up on google I get results that say ""best college majors for people who love to read."" Google doesn't understand my question, maybe you guys can.

I'm currently at a Liberal Arts University and realizing that a lot of reading is required. I've never been a reader, nothing wrong with Liberal Arts Majors, this just isn't for me personally. I'm considering dropping out. I understand that you have to read a lot in college, and I don't think I can do it.

You can find ""itsnotjoeybadass"" in the comments saying, ""Good luck kid."" I understand why he is saying that. He is saying that because he thinks I'm complaining about having to read, or that I'm naive somehow. His assumption is false, and based on his reddit profile he seems to be a very condescending person. His brain seems to be wired for negativity, his reddit profile gives me the impression that he's one of those douchey guys that make other people's lives worse. He could have just ignored my post, but he felt the need to insert a little mean comment to assert his dominance and pleasure his ego. What Joey's brain does not allow him to see is that I'm actually not complaining and that there's really nothing wrong with my post. I admit that college is likely not for me, I admit it is my problem, I admit that I am the one who is not good at reading, I am not blaming anyone or anything but me (well I did get a little angry at google... but google is not a person so I didn't think it would be that big of a deal). Yet, Joey had to be condescending anyway, because that is just the kind of garbage human being he is. My post was simply motivated by my realization that I can't succeed in college in my current major (my fault, no one elses). In my final attempts to avoid dropping out, I'm searching for ""non-reading"" majors, it's simply a thought experiment, but Joey can't seem to handle that. What Joey actually doesn't know about me is that I have been depressed and have had suicidal thoughts for about 3 years now. I'm 19, I'd like to make something of my life, but I seem to fail in every direction I take. I'm sure if I dropout of college and continue hating my life Joey will laugh and say good riddance.

To Joey: I'm sorry I didn't title this post: ""Best College Majors for People Who Are Bad at Reading?"" those combination of words would probably have resulted in a different comment from you. Overall though, it seems like the smallest little things can trigger your negativity, and I'm sorry about that. I see how ""Who Don't Like Reading?"" triggered you. I will be sure to try harder next time and be a better student and human being for you! Thank you, you go live your life now, good luck kid.

"Supposed to graduate this semester, but worried...","So I'm a computer science major who's two classes away from graduation. I just need to make a D in both these classes so that I can graduate and be done with college for good. One of these classes I believe I can make the D in, the other I'm highly uncertain. The assignments in this particular class are worth 30% of my grade (I can use Chegg to complete the assignments), the midterm is 30%, and the final is 40%. If I knew the questions that were on the midterm and final, I could find and memorize the answers, but I don't know the questions. I'm really desperate as I've been in college for 8 years. I'm considering offering the professor some money for a D grade, but I don't know how much. $300? $500? I can't go higher than $500 because I'm unemployed and need all the money I can save. Material from this class (Theory of Computation) will not be needed in any future career of mine, but it's a required course and so I have to take it and pass. Would the professor be understanding if I resorted to the above? I never had to do something like this before. But I was thinking I could put the money in a letter, go to office hours, mention I'm graduating and just need the minimum passing grade, and offer him the letter (""a letter from my parents"" I could say?).

How do I lose weight in college? (M18),"Currently I'm a freshman in college and I have found myself slowly gaining a few pounds over the course of the semester. I know I've had a long history with low metabolism and have repeatedly found myself gaining throughout the school year only to shed it all over the summer with a combination of eating less as a result of not having as much work and having more time to exercise. Last summer, I dropped to my lowest weight in a while, hitting 185 as a 6'2 male while also spending upwards of half an hour at the gym everyday burning calories on the elliptical. 

This semester, I tried to put myself on the same path, by consuming less food and playing sports as often as possible (I generally play a lot of racquet sports), but a tough schedule filled with homework has left me unable to find time to exercise and needing more food. My campus also isn't known for healthy food, so I don't even get the opportunity to eat healthy whenever I need to eat, and we also have a system of food that involves ""blocks"", so I'm almost forced to purchase a drink whenever I buy a meal just to use up a ""block"". 

Is there any way I can consistently lose weight with some simple exercises that don't take too long to do? I'm slowly getting more control over my schedule, but I still don't know if I can find a good enough time to exercise enough to cut down. Any help?",2,1,0.13075763492396583,college

How to deal with a tough professor?,"Background

- Exams are 95% of overall grade; 5% is attendance 
- Test 1 no one got over 90+; there is no curve
- 5 students got between 80-90
- Under 20 students got 70-80 (including me with a low 70)
- 100+ under 70 
- we just got an SI leader last week 


Today he lectured us how we aren’t doing enough and we are the reason for our failure.

H refuses to give us ALL the clues and hints or questions related to the exam, fair enough, but it’s a lot information

He gave us most of the exam on the review, but that only gets you a 70. He wants you to understand concepts inside and out (confusing question too or didn’t specify we needed to know real life current examples)

How can I get through a class that I am struggling mentally and emotionally on?,"I'm struggling with a class that I mentally can't get through. Its a 2 part class, I took one part last semester and ended up dropping it the week before finals because if I failed it, it would hurt my GPA. I had a small possibility of passing it but I didn't want to risk it. I'm now taking another part of the class this semester, since they interchange which one is given, and I just feel stressed and defeated already.


I've been fighting with myself just to study. I keep procrastinating and trying to do other stuff when I should be studying. I get crazy stressed, anxious and start shaking because I'm affraid I'll fail. Even if I do get myself to study FOR HOURS and feel confident with the material I still end up failing my test!


The way the professor teaches this class is just not how I learn. He is the only proffesor that gives this class in the college so I'm stuck with him. He asks us to read from the book, then during class all he does is talk about the thing, no notes from him, he talks so fast that while I'm trying to write something down he has already said 2 other important things that I've missed! And he expects us to remember every word he's said and read from the book. He expects us to describe and analyze things HIS way.  It also doesn't help the english is my second language.


I feel stressed and just over all nervous about this and don't know how to get through it. I want to cry just thinking about that class. Its a requirement for my major and I dont know what to do.

"I don't have any understanding of what constitutes a ""good"" grade and it's taking a toll on my emotional health.","(TL;DR at the bottom)

For some background: I'm in my first semester at a SLAC that I love, and I'm taking classes that really interest me and put me on track for the majors/minors I'm considering (politics, international relations, writing & rhetoric). For the most part, I'm exactly where I want to be—but my perfectionism won't stop nagging at me, and I'm realizing how inexperienced I really am in coping with it.

Throughout high school, I was consistently an A+ student, to the point where I didn't get a grade below an A on a single assignment until I got my first college essay grade back and received an A-. I know how ungrateful/petty/neurotic this makes me sound—and I am certainly neurotic—but I've been getting a few A- grades and think it's likely I'll end up with an A- instead of an A for one of my classes. At my school, an A- calculates out to a 3.7 GPA, while an A/A+ is a 4.0. 

When I see the A- on my grade reports, I can't help but feel anxious and start to berate myself.

I'm planning on applying to law schools after finishing my undergrad—no top 5s, but I'd like to go somewhere with a good reputation—and already find myself getting sucked back into the same perfectionistic, grade-driven mentalities that tormented me through high school.

I guess what I'm looking for is anyone who relates; anyone who can guide me as to what a ""good"" grade really is; anyone who has suggestions for how to re-frame my mindset so that I don't torture myself for what I think I should generally consider a good grade.

TL;DR: I got all A+ grades in high school and have received a number of A- grades on my essays since starting college this year. For some reason, this is starting to feel like a ""bad"" grade to me (even though it shouldn't) and I'm looking for advice on shifting this mindset.",4,2,0.31120902381285476,college
SAP appeal first semester as a transfer student,"Hey, guys. I'm a junior who just transferred from a community college with an associate's to a university, and due to withdrawing from two out of four of my classes (two of my classes have separate labs, so it's more like four classes), I will have to fill out a SAP appeal for next semester. I'm setting up an appointment with my advisor to complete my plan of study, and I have an appointment on the 29th at the student clinic to get my mental health assessed. My problem is that there's not one singular issue that contributed to me having to withdraw, but rather, a bunch of little ones. For example, I've been having financial issues and have to work from 11:30pm to 2:30am 6 days a week, had some surgical complications from an ingrown toenail procedure, and have been having a lot of mental health problems-- while I haven't been diagnosed yet, I believe that I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress from abuse I suffered from my step father. It's caused me to have really bad anxiety (I had previously been diagnosed with anxiety, but it's never been this severe) and nightmares that it often takes me over half the day to calm down from. This is the main reason I've missed class and been unable to focus on my studies. Does that SAP appeal committee expect one major event to have contributed to my withdrawal, or will they accept that it's been a mishmash of different factors?

My mom is very opposed to big schools; does she have a point?,"Essentially I'm applying for computer science, and a lot of the best universities for computer science are large, public institutions. There are smaller schools such as RPI and WPI which have good CS programs, but it seems like the best are usually either Ivies, MIT/Caltech, CMU, or... at a more reasonable target level, UW-Madison, Purdue, CU-Boulder, etc.

I think that going to a higher ranked university such as UW-Madison or Purdue might improve my job prospects noticeably, in comparison to something like RPI or WPI, which despite being well-known, might not have the same quality of CS education that is there in the public ivies.

My mom, however, is very opposed to me going to a big institution. She has very valid concerns such as it being difficult to form relationships with professors, or seek needed help, or it being very difficult to get around a huge campus etc. I am also in agreement with that. My dad would prefer for me to go to a bigger institution, saying that being flooded with ppl etc is ""part of growing up"" and that a bigger institution would offer more opportunities.

One thing which I think a bigger institution might have is a party scene. I'd really like to be able to party, meet girls, etc but this is of course much harder at a school with the RPI ratio (lol). It's not everything, but it is something. A lot of people only start dating in university, and I feel like partying once or twice a week is unlikely to have such serious ramifications for me. A place like Madison or Boulder might also offer more opportunities for extracurricular activities such as sports, or research activities. 

Bigger schools might also have a larger alumni network.

Again, I don't know, I'm just asking for what your opinions are. I know bigger schools might actually suck for the reasons I mentioned; however a lot of the higher rated schools are big CS schools. I feel like this might make more opportunities open to me. Furthermore, as I said, social life is also a factor; I want to have the ""college experience.""

Another thing I should mention is that my parents live abroad, as do I, so all of these schools are OOS for me. Private schools have no tuition differential for being OOS anyways, but yeah that's just a point that I think is important to recognize. My family's income is roughly $200k per year, which while high, means that tuition might make a fair amount of difference, especially with my brother heading off to uni as well in a few years from now. I don't know, though.

Transferring - what's my next step?,"I'm currently a first year student majoring in film production at a school on the east coast. It's safe to say that I'm not enjoying my time here too much. For one, my initial goal was to become a screenwriter and write for TV, but I always had this doubt in the back of my head even before coming to school. Now that I'm here, I realized that my heart wasn't really in it, and I'm definitely a lot more ambivalent about the future. I've also had trouble fitting into the culture here, and it's been hard making friends. And to top it off, a week after I moved in, my grandma ended up in the hospital and that fucked me up. I'm 1000 miles away from home and feeling as if I had no control made me very upset. I'm halfway into the semester and I'm depressed, unmotivated, and lonely.

I decided that I wanted to transfer somewhere close to home, but I'm not sure what steps I should take. Ideally, I'd like to take the next semester off, take classes at community college, then transfer for fall 2020, but I don't think my parents would let me do that and I'm afraid of my credits not transferring as well (I also want to switch majors from film production to sociology).

I am failing a class that I have already taken before? What to do?,"So I have just transferred from a 4 year school to another 4 year school. I had finished Calculus 1 with a B at University, finished Calc 2 with a C after withdrawing from it in the summer due to a death in the family. I had a 3.56 GPA  as a double Neuro and CS major with my only weakness really being calculus before this. My new school did not take my credits for Calc 1 and 2, so I had to start over. 



Now, the math department selected my classes for me, so I didn't get a say in professor. My professor has like a 2 star rating on ratemyprofessors, with multiple comments saying beware, worse teacher I've ever had at this institution, fails everyone and the department is okay with these complaints, etc.  I tried to brave through it, because I know calculus. Maybe not perfectly, but I thought I had a good grasp before. I spend hours studying and doing homework. I had tutoring from math majors. I went to my teacher and asked if she had any examples of old exams or practice problems and she said she didn't give out practice questions or old exams. Whenever I missed a couple classes due to a serious medical concern, I went to her office and asked for clarification on some notes, and she brushed me off and wouldn't explain the concepts, just got up and walked out when I asked her a question.



I failed the first exam. A whopping 60. My professor makes her own questions and does not coordinate with the other calc classes who have totally different test questions/department exams. The questions are not like those in the textbook. No partial credit. I think the class average was around 60-70, and I saw no one get higher than a B- on their exam. My professor says she does not believe in curving grades, and said that those of us who expressed concerns about their grades need to stop worrying because she knows way more than we do about how to do her job, and that she has had classes before where many people do bad, there's nothing to be done about it. She also cursed in my face for telling her I couldn't find her office hours (I'm dyslexic)





I just got my second exam back, and I got a 59. The last day to withdraw is next week. I feel sick because I will most likely have to transfer again (I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after starting school here and I want to be closer to home) but I want to apply to Emory, which is rather selective. How bad will it look if I withdraw from this class if I am trying to transfer again and I want to go to grad school in the future? I think it looks very bad because I withdrew from Calc 2 in the past.

Senior Year & Relationships,"So I am currently a senior. Do not worry - finding a relationship or women are not a priority for me BUT I got hit with the reality that once I graduate, it will be *much* harder to meet women than it is now.

My current body / hook-up count is almost twice my ACT score. I have a solid friends (mainly guys) and am considered extroverted. I came into this school year three weeks ago that I will get rid of my 'degeneracy' and I will try a dating early on. Met someone at a school concert and once I got to know her I thought she could've been girlfriend material. Well this was my third actual date (ever) with intentions of not just a one night stand... I felt extremely empty after she left. I got blocked too once I found her on Tinder the next week and hit her with the ""Which way do I swipe"" DM.

Should I try to actually go on wholesome dates? Unfortunately I 'glew up' my senior year of high-school and my parents are divorced. I have no idea how relationships are supposed to work - I have only been exposed to casual encounters.

I dropped my Calc II class after having a rough time with how the prof taught and how I learn, and now I am on the cusp of dropping Physics I after a crappy first exam. We only have three exams + a final that make most of the grade, and since I did so bad on the first test, there’s definitely no salvaging my grade at this point (also doesn’t help that the prof plays favorites and I’m not one of ‘em).

The only issue is that Physics is a 4 unit class, which means if I do drop it, I would go under full- time, bringing myself to a whopping 11 units, 1 unit away from being a full-time student. So does anyone have any experience with something like this? I’m going in early tomorrow to talk to a counselor to see what my options are, but with it being so late in the semester, I’m not sure there’s anything I can do/anything I can add to get to that full-time status. 

TIA!",4,0,1.0643340238128547,college
Parents keep telling me what to do,"Hi, I’m a college sophomore (actuarial science major). You’d think that my parents would be used to me being away and making my own decisions but I guess not!

The big fight tonight was that I want to go on a one week residency/service trip in Vancouver with my school’s orchestra but it’s happening during a normal school week. I want to expand my horizons and I’ve never left the country nor will I ever be able to study abroad since I’m on a non-major orchestra scholarship that requires me to be in orchestra every semester.

Should I turn in a student for blatant cheating on an exa in a difficult upper-division course?,"Some background that I feel is pertinent to this situation:
This is an extremely difficult, upper-division, major-related course necessary for graduation at a large state university in California. It is a 400-level course. This class is so hard that the original enrollment of 65 is already down to less than 30 students 2 months into the semester. This class requires extreme dedication and persistence to pass. 
In addition to this, the class is curved; not on a normally distributed bell curve, but instead is contingent on the highest few grades in the class and how the professor feels the class is performing. 

That said, on the first exam that happened 2 weeks ago, a student who never attends lecture was googling the answers to all the exam questions on his phone during the test. The professor never saw him despite my subtle glances. I do not know the student’s name, but would recognize him. 

I am wondering if I should let the professor know. I am fairly close with him and have established a good rapport through office hours, being diligent in my assignments, and doing thorough coursework. I scored a 104% on the exam, but am worried about future exams/assignments as well as the grades of some friends I have in the class. If he (the cheater) scores exceptionally high on the next few exams/assignments, his cheating could negatively impact the rest of our grades, despite his lack of effort. I believe the class average for the exam fell around a 54%. I do not know how he scored, I just know it was lower than me. 

I’m not a “snitch”, nor have I ever turned someone in before. It goes against the elementary school mentality I have unfortunately adopted towards “snitches”, and have always thought that cheating would catch up with the individual eventually. But in this case it looks like he might get away with it to the detriment of the rest of us. I feel cheated myself and like my efforts to achieve a good grade are in vain. Why should someone who doesn’t work for a good grade “earn” one? 

I’m assuming he would likely get expelled, which I’m not thrilled about nor do I wish upon someone. 

Am I acting entitled/childish, or do I have a reason to be upset? Should I let it go and hope it catches up with him elsewhere? I don’t feel good about either option. Please advise. 

PS: if all you have to say is something about snitches being bitches or getting stitches, please bite your tongue. I know how it goes.

The same assignment that was an 80 the week before was a failing grade the next. He also lost his wife last semester. At times, his speech was incomprehensible.

Need advice on withdrawing from a Sociology class.,"I'm currently taking 13 credits. This Sociology class is 3 credits. Without it, I would be at 10 credits.

Basically, this is an accelerated 12 week class, twice a week on campus. I have not passed one assignment. I had 2 reading quizzes worth 6% of my grade, I got a 0/5 on one and a 2/5 on the other. Then there are 2 exams worth 20% EACH of my grade: I only scored 27/75 and I haven't taken exam 2 yet. Plus the final is worth 25%. The content is just incredibly hard as it's all essay questions on the exams.

I'm just feeling so lost because when I do the math, it seems like the highest I'd be able to get now is about a 50% and I need this class to transfer (at 75%). Obviously that isn't going to happen.

I also get Pell Grant full time and this would knock me to part time status UNLESS I can maybe potentially enroll in a class tomorrow after withdrawing from this one? Idk if I'll have to pay back the excess aid or not.

Academic Trouble,"I'm a first year in college and I really need help. I am in serious academic trouble and I need to fix it fast. First of all, my parents had threatened that if I don't make deans list, they're not going to pay for any of my college which is a B+ average. For my college, the 80th percentile is 3.6. I'm taking four four credit classes right now. Half of them are going swimmingly. I have almost a 100% in music theory and calculus 1. I am worried though in math that I didn't start advanced enough and that I'm already ineligible for a math major. I took AP Calculus AB in high school and got a 4 on it. There are three levels of math available to first years, and I'm taking the middle level of calc 1. But most of the math majors here already took the fourth level of the mid track or took the first level of the honors track. I'm now going to have to take more classes or take accelerated summer courses just to catch up because I'm already dangerously behind (there are first years in level 4 on the honors track already). I could have taken the second level of the mid track because you can bypass calc 1 if you have a 4 or 5 on AB, but they didn't recommend that 4's do it. If I could go back in time in high school, I would have busted my ass to get 5s on everything and taken many more AP classes than I did (also BC, not AB calc). 

French and Physics are my trouble spots.  My french professor used the word ""unacceptable"" on my essay and gave me a 75% for there being a few grammar errors on my essay. I'm not sure how the last test went but as of now I have a grade in the 70s range. Physics is just very hard in general. Similar to math, there are three levels so I took the first class or the honors track. But we're already in multivariable calculus and time dilation for mechanics.

Transfer freshman year or sophomore year?,"I'm currently a nursing student at my college and I want to transfer out of it while still being in the nursing major. I am wanting to transfer to either Pitt (in state) or WVU (out of state), depending on who accepts me and the tuition cost. I am open to other colleges as well for their nursing programs.

The dilemma I face is if I should transfer at the end of my sophomore year or freshman year. For Pitt if I transfer my freshman year I would be put in the freshman nursing class. If I would transfer my sophomore year I could try to apply for the sophomore nursing class in Pitt. 

For WVU if I apply at the end of my sophomore year I could be accepted in the nursing program as a sophomore. If I apply at the end of my freshman year I would be accepted into the pre-nursing program and have to apply for nursing after one semester of pre-nursing.

My parents want me to be accepted directly in the nursing program, but I don't know if I agree with that. I'm not sure if it's worth taking the risk of going into a pre-nursing program and then having to apply to the nursing program.",1,1,1.4393803201091508,college

How to Get Into Work Mode?,"I'm 8 weeks deep in my first semester of college, and I've been struggling with getting work done on big assignments that should be spread out and done over the course of a few weeks or so. I recently had an interesting revelation about how I work: if I had an entire day to work on an essay and the essay is due in a week and a half, I drag and feel like I can't get anything meaningful done, but if I have 8 hours until an essay needs to be submitted and I haven't even started, I go into full-on work mode and get it done no problem. This leads me to believe that if I can get myself into that same mindset of ""this assignment is due very soon and it has to be done now"" even if I have plenty of time left to work on it, it would make long-term assignments infinitely easier than they currently are for me.

This means that, since scholarships are generally disbursed directly to the university, I'd have to pay 10-20% of the scholarship amount out of pocket to \[state in which I'm attending college\].

I'm studying psychology but I'm not sure if it's the right choice,"I started college 3 weeks ago now. I'm studying psychology and I think it's really interesting I can see myself as a psychologist in the future but all my classes consist of sitting in a massive room with 600 other people and listening to the professor for 3hours on end twice a day (so 6h) and taking notes. I know this is how most studies work thats just college but part of me wishes that I had to actually do more.

I'm a pretty creative person, I like making this or doing more practical things but your chances of getting a decent job with a creative study is pretty small in my country so I went with psychology, something academical that also interests me but sitting and listening for hours everyday is just making me feel sad.

Before I choose psychology I considered architecture because altough it is academical it us also very creative (half the subjects are about design and making things). The artistic character of it seems perfect for me but I'm not sure if I'll actually like being an architect in the future, I'm afraid that the study is more fun than the actual job.

Tl;DR
Im studying psychology, it's interesting and I can see myself being a psychologist but it's not artistic enough for me.
Architecture is far more creative which is great but I'm afraid that architect as a job later will not be as creative as the study.

Having a hard time with online Biology classes.,"Hi everyone! 

I’m currently in my last semester before I finally get my associates degree and I’m honestly extremely excited to finish something that my family couldn’t normally do. For this last semester I was needing two science classes along with my other 3 classes, the issue is, my two biology classes are online and I’ve never taken an online course before.

I’ve never experienced such a work load from two online biology classes, having to do 1010 and 1020 at the same time, doing a total of 40 learning activities that are quizzes and readings that take about 20-30 mins each. All of it needs to be done in a week and a half. Along with my other classes and working on the weekends. I honestly need some advice on how to make better notes when reading my sections. Cause I’ll have a lot of notes but when it comes time to the quizzes, I don’t do well because I didn’t have all the info I needed. It’s become really exhausting to the point that I’m losing motivation and I’m getting behind.

Does anyone have any kind of advice to me situation? Anything would help at this point.

Going back to business or going for literature..,"This is gonna be a long one but please stick with me~

Im an 18 y/o and I started college this year. My major course is BBA which is Bachelor of Business Administration. I've never had a dream job I've wanted so when my mother suggested this course I agreed to it cus it looked alright and it made my parents happy. But it's been 4 months since college started and I'm downright miserable.

The people in my class are mostly kinda insufferable ( I'm not saying this to be uptight ) . I come from one of the top schools and my hobbies include literature and social studies. I'm a person with solid interest in politics , literature , current affairs the whole shabang. But my classmates are mostly not as interested so it's difficult for me to hold any conversations with them. They the kinda people who still deny climate crisis and think I'm crazy just for 'reading books for pleasure' .  I've had atleast 20 people give me crazy looks cus I prefered to sit in the library to read my novel rather than going with them to the nearby beach to smoke up and bunk the lectures. Plus the subjects I've been learning are easy for me but I'm having no interest in them at all. All these factors together have given me solid anxiety about college. Even just thinking of going to college the next day gives me solid anxiety and I'm counting down days till my term gets over . On top of that I have been struggling with loneliness throughout the day and my current college ends at 1pm and I'm home alone till the next day so I always feel lonely and just sleep it off  

Now I became interested in another college course called BA or Bachelor of Arts in English. I feel like it's the right course for me and some of my close school friends are in that college as well. If I go to this college my timings would be till 5pm and I'm going to be with my close friends so atleast I won't be a lonely chump the entire day. I've also started having interest in being an Air hostess and this degree would do me good for that. My parents are thankfully very supportive and won't mind me dropping BBA to start BA but I'm scared . What if I go to the other college and start hating that college as well? Should I just stick to my existing major or go for something I feel is the right course for me? I'm very afraid of having college anxiety in the second college as well if I go there. What do I do?

This is random but can professors see the amount of times a student searches their name up to find what classes they’re teaching? (during the enrollment period),"I think I might’ve screwed up. I had an extraordinary professor last semester. I wanted to take another class with him this semester but every time I would search his name up on the schools website for course enrollment, I kept getting one class show up and it’s the one I already took. I know he teaches more classes so I figured there might be an error in the system or they haven’t updated his schedule yet.. his classes tend to get filled up almost immediately soooo not wanting to miss out on the opportunity, I would search his name up on the enrollment website like every other day in the summertime. 
Fast forward to this semester, I see that professor in the hallways occasionally and say hi. He comes off as cold and distant, which is unlike him, he’s really nice to everyone. So, I was thinking “huh, I wonder what’s going on”..then, a lightbulb went off in my head. It never occurred to me that professors could see how many times their name/class is searched for. More specifically, which student searches them up. If that’s the case, I really fucked up and probably come off as some psycho student to this professor. Lol

So, does anyone know if professors have access to how many times their name or classes are searched up? And does it indicate which student it was? I know it’s not the same for every college but if another college has this information available, chances are, other colleges do too. 😬",7,2,1.916718283072114,college
wanting to transfer... to europe,"long story short, i was abroad in europe all of last year. the idea started as an escape but i was genuinely happy & in love with my life there. now i’m back, everything is different and i’m so sad, all the time. i’ve started putting effort into making sure i stay mentally healthy, but this can only go so far when i’m in an environment i have no desire to be in.

Roommate plays video games and it's messing up my sleep schedule,"I'm going into my last year of college and I'm renting an apartment for my living situation. I got a new roommate and he moved in the other month so I suppose we're still adjusting to each other's lifestyles.

He plays video games and specifically League of Legends like its a full time job. Every waking hour he's playing video games at his desk and he seldom leaves - maybe only to get food or whatever. I love video games as much as the next person and I've had my fair share of Dota. My problem is that he's on a voice call with someone for every single game and he honestly sounds like the stereotypical league player.

I'm an incredibly light sleeper which is my curse to carry. As per reddit earplug recommendation, I bought Howard Leight earplugs which are great, a sleeping mask, and doxylamine succinate  . Again, I'm a light sleeper and practically any noise wakes me up. My roommate loves to play video games or he's basically on a voice call until like 2 AM. Howard Leight is not effective at blocking his fervent screams for healing and whatever. I need to be up at 6 AM almost everyday and I just cannot sleep like this.

What do I do Reddit? I had a talk with him the other day that went along the lines of how he's keeping me up at night and that he needs to stop screaming when I'm trying to sleep. He seemed pretty receptive to it, but he's still on league doing his voice calls. I'm not his parents so I probably can't change his habits of video games.

*Why do I feel anxious when I see people from my high school I've never talked to before?*

I kind of feel that this is a super irrational fear because:

1. I don't know these people AT ALL
2. They have nothing against me that could embarrass me

Now, note that I don't experience this fear or nervousness with people I used to talk to in high school – just the ones I've seen in some of my classes, walking around during passing period, etc.

Thanks in advance for any comments or thoughts! :)",2,5,2.3221580978869287,college

Confused about Greek life and partying,"This may seem like a weird and desperate post, but here goes: I am currently a college freshman interested in going to at least one party during my time here, as well as joining a fraternity. The problem is that I have no idea how to do this. I am only part of one club because there are literally no other clubs on campus that correspond with my current interests, I don't play any team sports*, and my attempts to make friends outside of clubs have fallen flat because everybody in classes and, especially, in my dorms seems very apathetic. The only places where I felt like I actually fit in were fraternities; I decided to attend the rush season events at a couple and made several friends there, but I only get to see one of them on a regular basis through a club and asking the others via Instagram etc. whether they're doing anything cool will just come off as desperate.

What should I do, then, to increase my chances of getting invited to parties as well as being offered a bid by a fraternity? Regarding fraternities, I feel like the rush events don't give me enough time to prove my value to the brothers and demonstrate that I have similar values to those of the organisation. Is there anything else that might help win them over? (Also, if you suggest that I bring girls with me to get invited, you are the blind optimist of the millennium.)

Believe it or not, I am not a party animal, I don't drink or smoke, and partying is very low on the list of reasons why I am interested in joining a fraternity. For some reason, though, I still really want to go to a college party to experience it at least once, to meet new people, and to prove to myself that I can, in fact, manage to get into one after 19 miserable years of social rejection and ostracism.

*Regarding team sports, I am considering joining rugby, which is an open club sport, but I don't know whether I will enjoy it enough to justify the time commitment (casting aside the nebulous social benefits that it may or may not provide). I used to really like skiing and alpine ski racing, but am burnt out after last ski season for several reasons and don't know whether I want to get back into it this season.",2,3,2.3385701349239656,college

Extracarricular activities on scholarship application?,"Hi! I’m filling out an application for a fellowship program! I’m a Computer Science major, a senior but with about 1 1/2 to go before I graduate. They ask for extracurriculars I participated in in high school/college but in high school I didn’t do sports or volunteer work. 
My main hobby was drawing and that was it. 

In college, I haven’t participated in much, most of my time consisted of my work-study jobs (2) in community college and my current part time job that I care a lot about at the community college that I graduated from (involving data management, maintaining the database of student info through the multiple platforms we use to do so for the EOF program whose goals, impact, and students I care a lot about). 

I also still draw. I am also currently a part of a mentoring program where I mentor community college STEM students during their (upcoming) transition to a 4-year, but I just started that this week.

I also am about to build my own computer.

I wanted to know if there’s anything worthwhile that I do that I could somehow list as an extracurricular or would most of this just fall under my resumé? I feel like my resumé wouldn’t reflect the interests and passions I have.

tl;dr: What counts as an extracurricular? Can part of your work count as an extracurricular?",0,2,2.381567820109151,college

"Going Back To College, Selective Service?","My boyfriend is in his thirties and he's planning on going back to

college. The college is requiring that he registered for Selective

Service. He looked up his information on the website and it says

he never signed up. He never knew about it as he just assumed if there's

ever a draft that he and every other man would be called upon if the time

came.

His father never knew about it because he was born before 1960. His mother

never knew about it. He turned 18 between his junior and senior year of high

school, so he was never told about it. During his senior year of high

school, he was actually planning on joining the army. The recruitment

officer said he wouldn't qualify because of a medical condition, and he

never mentioned selective service.

I just found out that California is one of the few states that doesn't

automatically register men into Selective Service. When he went to college

in his twenties, he didn't need financial aid. He's never applied for

This is where the conflict starts. I am a marketing major and a technology-lover. I was apprehensive to handwrite my notes, simply because typing my notes has proven extremely effective for me. I gave her method a chance up to the first exam.

At the next lecture, I took it upon myself to create a Word document to imitate the Cornell method in a way that would work better for me. This cracked on!

That is, until the professor noticed I was typing my notes and halted her lecture to reprimand me. She gave me no explanation as to why I couldn't type my notes, simply stating ""That's not what we're doing here"". I thought her demand was particularly absurd because our 400 level class is hosted in a computer lab.

She finished off the three hour lecture with a Powerpoint slideshow about the benefits of the Cornell method and the rules that came along with it:  No typing notes & no recording lectures. It felt like the slideshow was specifically for me.

Let me know what you all think of this. I think it is completely unreasonable and unfair, and I can't see why she would be so adamant about this method. I don't understand why she feels it is right to *require* her students to take notes in any particular fashion.",12,29,3.277609486775818,college

A Few Newb Questions,"I'm a 24 year old male and I'm going to community college this spring to start acquiring credits to complete a CS degree. I have a couple of pretty simple questions... the advisor I spoke with was sort of helpful but mostly not. 

1. I half-assed some college courses when I was 19. I think I got a 3.0 in Eng Comp 101 and a 3.0-3.5 in 102. How much of a negative effect will it be to keep these grades? Would it be worth it to retake them and get the easy A? I would really rather not if I have time to make up for it. 

2. My advisor was suggesting that I take their placement test in math and try to score into pre-cal. I haven't taken a math course in about 5 years. I am going through the algebra courses on khan academy and it is coming back to me but given that I am very rusty I feel I might be better off taking the hit and starting at college algebra to ensure I do well and build a good foundation. To those who have been through it, good idea or push harder?

3. I'm able to find admissions requirements for both of the in-state 4-years I would like to transfer to but my advisor kept saying that she didn't know how 'competitive' the programs are. How much more is there to getting accepted than admissions requirements?",4,2,3.3420076349239656,college

Good Retaliation against another floor?,"So let me start from the beginning.

I stay on the 4th floor of my residence hall, the top floor. All year long, the people in the room below me (I’m just going to refer to them as 339 since that’s their room number)  have gained a reputation of blasting dubstep music from 9 pm - 3 am on random days. We stomp, they hit the ceiling back, and nothing happens we just end up ignoring it.

Last night, my roommate had two friends over to study for a midterm. And then they started playing music extremely loud. So all four of us in the room all starting jumping on the floor as a message to shut the hell up. Then, they had the audacity to come up to our room, knock on our door, and tell us to quit stomping. This resulted with my roommate slamming the door in their face. They knocked again, and I just started bumping music loud back. 

However, when I left the room later that night, I noticed the name tags on our door (so the RA knows who’s in what room) were gone. We couldn’t think of anyone else who would’ve taken them besides 339. As a result, we went down to there room and they had a bunch of paper ghosts on the door as decoration. We took all of them and put them on our door, then wrote our names on 2 of them.

Waking up this morning, the hall is littered with people’s name tags and decorations of their doors. The table at the end of the halls used for studying we’re both flipped. One person had a doorbell on the front of their door that was stolen.

Should I skip my physics exam tomorrow?,"Hi all, I got caught up in work and other family activities this week and the next thing I know, my first physics test of the semester is in 10 hours.

But if I were to take the test, do poorly on it and get a 30, for example, then that 30 stays permanently. It doesn't get dropped because the professor doesn't drop the lowest exam grade; he only drops the first test that you miss. Missing any more tests will be given a permanent zero.  


Either that, or I can stay up all night and do a bunch of problems from our homework.

Art College,"I'm a 2D digital artist, self-taught, unprofessional. I want to fine-tune my skills and become a professional artist, but I'm not 100% sure where I want to go to do that, or if college is even the best place for it. I have almost completely decided on Rocky Mountain College of Art & Design, but it's SO expensive, even if they say it's considerably less than most other normal colleges or art colleges out there.

I don't want to go into community college. I want to be in a college (online or a local campus- am NOT willing to travel/move) specifically tailored to artists. But it's really hard for me to find things like that, oddly enough. RMCAD is my best bet, but... the pricing and the fact that I'll have 9k to owe afterward terrifies me. I don't want to go into debt, even if it's ""commonplace"" among college-goers.

The reviews for RMCAD have been mixed, especially those from around 2014-2016 when it was under different/horrible management. Things are supposedly much better now, and the advisors I've spoken with over the last week or so have been SUPER nice and friendly. It all sounds so good, so inviting, so reassuring. Even with my cost woes, and the worry that as a for-profit school, they're only so nice because their job is to recruit students to help pay the school off or whatever.

I've never done college before. I'm completely new to it, and I'm not naive. I know a lot goes into it. But I'm terrified of making the wrong choice, or disappointing family with my decision to go to RMCAD since they've expressed worries/concerns and think I'm rushing into things. I'm also worried that I won't be able to find many jobs with this degree (I'm heavily interested in the Illustration degree, because I don't want to do graphic design or animation (I'm interested in that (and game design), but at the same time I want to hone my illustration skills first, at least)

I’m thinking of transferring from a large urban university to a mid-size rural university. Is this a good idea? Could any students from mid-size rural universities share their wisdom?,"I’m currently a freshman at a school in one of the biggest cities in the US. And it turns out I kind of hate living in the city! I’m much better suited for a rural environment. My university has a lot of good qualities, but I feel like the fact that I already feel like I’ve made a bad choice is a big red flag. 

Good things about my school:

- only a little over an hour from my hometown, so I can go home every weekend 

- I can take public transportation to get anywhere I need to go

- the school has a pretty good reputation in the eyes of potential employers 

- the school is really well-funded and has a lot of great academic resources 

Bad things about my school:

- it’s difficult to make friends because (a) most of the students are commuters and (b) the “city personality” is very common here, people act very cold and closed-off

- my major feels like an afterthought here - the university is geared towards STEM students and I’m not in any of those programs. My major only gets part of one floor of an old building on the outskirts of campus.

- there’s a lot of crime on and near campus. I don’t like walking home at night, though I often have to because of work. 

- like I mentioned before, I don’t particularly like living in the city. 

I’ve been looking at affordable schools I could potentially transfer to. I found one that seems promising. It’s a medium-sized public university that is, by my standards, rural (the city it’s in has a population of like 60,000 and the population density is pretty low. So *technically* it’s in a city, but compared to what I’m used to, it’s not). They have a very strong program for my major. I’m thinking of potentially making the switch, but I’d like to hear from students who go to school in similar environments to what I’m thinking of switching to. Obviously, the school has great information online regarding their academics, but what about the other stuff? What’s the social scene like? How do people make friends there? What do people do for fun? What should I know before I apply? Thanks in advance for any advice!",2,3,3.9971465238128547,college

It didn't bother me much, because its just a first exam, and per the syllabus and Canvas, this course does not use a weighted grading scale. I had a 100 percent prior to this exam.

Today, I was talking to some classmates during break about the possibility of taking Managerial Accounting (the second half of the course) during the winter intersession. He butted in the conversation by saying that im not even passing his class, and that I probably wont even make it that far. He hasn't put the exam in the gradebook yet, but I did some simple math and found that I will have a high C once he does. I tell him that the grades arent weighted so I am not worried about it. Homework for the chapter is typically 100ish points, and I could recover from the C. He says ""I guess I have to fix that, Exams are worth 40 percent of your grade"". I pulled out the syllabus and he says its a ""Misprint"". 

&#x200B;

He's a cool guy but he's retiring this year. He's a full time accountant so he really is only doing this for fun (his words) and we feel like he might fuck our grades with no sweat.

Is he allowed to change the syllabus like this? To be honest I would never take a class where tests are almost HALF of your grade.",3,3,4.037123375664707,college
When is it okay to report your group members?,"I have a group project in we analyse 2 cases based on theory. We had split the group of 6 into 2 sub-groups for each case. 

In my group, there's this girl, A, who is gave shitty work. I had explained to her what her part of the theory and analysis should include, and she gave me decent theory definitions but her analyses are one-liners without any citations or supportive evidence. I knew this ahead of time and knew to bug her to do her work or change unsuitable content. I constantly highlighted what A went wrong and told her to explained what kind of evidence she should provide and how she should link it to the theory. After days of constant monitoring, she finally had decent work that could be used after some minor editing. 

Thing is, English is not A's first language, therefore I try to put up with her low quality work. But this doesn't excuse the fact that she was constantly unavailable for meetings and not properly citing her analysis (we're in psych, citations are psych 101). Friends who saw how stress out I was recommended me to report her, but she wasn't neglecting her part and had always changed her content accordingly after each of my comment.

In the other sub-group, this girl, B, had a slightly better grasp on English compared to A. She wrote her analysis with citations and supporting evidence, but she did not explain the theory nor were the analyses based on the theory. Therefore, it was totally not salvageable as it was completely irrelevant and out of topic. The other members of the sub group had only realised the shoddy work when they were doing the final editing the night before submission. In the end, they ended up rewriting B's whole part to make it in time for submission as it was late at night then and she was not online.

They left her out of the analysis part in the work distribution table, and B was not happy with it. She said that we should have informed her that her work was not usable and had her change it, instead of just overwriting her part. My friends in that sub-group did agree that they could have monitored B like how I did to A, but they are busy with their own work as well. They had thought that since B had better writing skills than A, she wouldn't needed to be monitored.

The thought of reporting B did occur, but ultimately she still did not neglect her part. She did what was assigned, but unfortunately it was of low quality.

We chose not to report A or B for group negligence, but I wanted to know if Reddit agrees with the decision or if you guys think they should be reported.",7,1,4.040051616405448,college
Need Roommate Advice. Am I exaggerating or being rational?,"I’ve been living with my Chinese roommate at university for 2 months now. It’s his first time in the US, and he came here from China to study. Since the beginning he’s had some habits that I was taught were disrespectful or rude to demonstrate around other people. I’ve never told him to stop since I assumed that these habits were probably overlooked in Chinese culture, but lately these habits have been bugging me so much that I CAN’T concentrate when studying to trying to fall asleep. I want to bring it up to him to see if he can change but sometimes I think I’m exaggerating. He’s a nice guy, and I’m sure he doesn’t intend on being rude so please let me know if I’m just overreacting.

Habits:

First, he chews gum SO LOUD. I mean I can hear this guy chewing gum with his door closed. Our room is usually VERY quite (we don’t even have a tv). We study A LOT and when he chews gum during these moments it’s all I can hear. Sometimes I can’t even study in peace because it’s so loud, and I end up having to go to the library to finish my studying.

Second, he doesn’t pick up his feet when he walks. He just slides across the room and makes the loudest noise possible. I remember as a kid walking like this and my mom telling me that I was being obnoxious and to pick up my feet. Does anybody else hate when people don’t pick up their feet when they walk? Especially if you’re trying to sleep?

Third, after he showers he leaves dirty flip-flop footprints in our bathtub and water puddles on the bathroom floor. I have NO idea how he showers. I’ve never seen him take a towel into the bathroom when showering. Also, you would think that the water running in the tub during his shower would remove the dirt from the tub floor (even if he’s showering with flip-flops on) but it doesn’t! When I walk in to the bathroom after he gets out of a shower I notice that he tilts the shower head all the way down when showering. Maybe he just soaks his hair while standing in the tub with flip flops on? Is is customary for Chinese people to shower like that and leave not mind puddles of water on the floor after getting out of the tub?

Please let me know your thoughts. I hope these observations aren’t seen as being racist. I don’t think bad about Chinese people. I just find certain habits of my roommate to be very annoying and I have no idea to what extent this is due to his culture.",5,5,4.0541256904795215,college

Should I bother finding an internship at nearly 30?,"I’m a journalism minor and need an internship to graduate next semester but I’m mainly running into unpaid internships, which are basically slavery from what I’ve heard. I still have applied to several (and a few paid ones which I likely won’t hear back from) but I’m kind of regretting it now.

My advisor did mention that if I did not find an internship that I could swap the internship course for another journalism class but I wouldn’t receive the minor (journalism would just become a focus in my program). 

I just feel so behind and over it and the thought of enduring an unpaid internship seems like torture. I’d rather just get my degree and look for a job afterwards.

Is Financial Accounting really as hard as people make it out to be?,"Hey all.

In regards to my core classes for my business program, two accounting courses and a capstone class are the only credits I need for my business AS degree. Through out my studies, many of my fellow students make accounting look to be a course that is unforgiving.

I went over a introductory lesson on YouTube and so far, it isn't that bad so far. I learned about the accounting equation; Assets = Liability + Owner's Equity. I know I have to study the concepts a lot to understand how to apply them. For people who took accounting or are majoring in it, how do you handle your studies?

I already have a 4 year degree from an elite school.  I'm well established in my career but have become somewhat bored in it and want to take some courses to boost my GPA into the A range.

\-School must be Regionally accredited

\-Must not have jacked up tuition rates for International students online.

\-I'm also open to suggestions for Canadian schools or South African (online part time programs). As I live between there are South Africa mainly.

\-Ideally the cost should be below $10k CAD in total for a years attendance, but am willing to pay up to $13k or so (about 10k usd)

How do I deal with not having a party life?,"I'm a sophomore pre-med student at a school reputed both for its social scene and its tough classes. I'm generally happy with my day-to-day life: classes are going well and I'm passionate about my clubs. I don't have a ton of friends, but I have a few that I love.

Between studying for classes (like orgo :/), clubs, and decompressing alone (I'm an introvert and I have a single, so I spend a fair bit of time in there), I don't have a lot of time left over. Here's the thing, though: even when I do have the time, I can't find people to party with. I don't have a friend ""group"" so much as I have individual friends (some of whom don't get along with each other). My friends have their own groups, like their suites or people from their sororities, that they party with. Sometimes my clubs have party-like events, but these are few and far in between, especially because most of my ECs are academically focused. Most Fridays and Saturdays, I just study or watch Netflix because all my friends are busy with their own groups, going to frat parties and tailgates etc. When I try to make plans with them, they usually are already busy or have plans to go to the event with other people. The first weekend of school, I stayed in my single and got a headstart on my class readings because I had absolutely nothing else to do. On Sundays, I study with my friends. That's the issue -- I feel like I'm viewed as more of an academic friend than a ""go out and have fun"" friend. I admit that I probably caused this myself -- last year I stopped drinking for a while and wasn't as inclined towards going out.

How do I deal with this? It's gotten to the point that I dread Fridays and Saturdays -- I prefer the hectic and stressful Sunday - Thursday. I also have a bit of an issue with social media (I spend too much time on it). Because I go to a party school, my feed is constantly flooded with party posts from Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Even on Tuesday nights, I often see people around campus heading to parties. I've considered a couple different solutions, including joining a sorority. However, I know a sorority is incredibly time consuming and don't want my academics to take a hit. I have friends in sororities, but I'm still concerned that I won't really fit in because I'm pretty quiet. Anyone have any ideas for what I should do? All suggestions are welcome!

First Day of Class but I think I need to switch! What do I do?!,"I've already withdrawn from a bunch of classes this semester (because I decided to change my major and they don't overlap). I signed up for an online 8-week SPEECH course to salvage what I can and this is the first day of ""class"". The course description simply said I need ""access to technology"" and that was the only difference. So I assumed I could present my speeches using the webcam on my laptop - because that is what many of my friends did with their speech classes at other institutions.

HOWEVER, I go onto blackboard today to check the syllabus (which was NOT accessible until this morning) and my speech class is making me 1) download specific software to use 2) is assuming I have a seperate webcam that I can move to another place 3) find at least 8 people to fill a room to present my speech to and I have to pan the room for proof 4) I also am required to clearly hold up my license to the camera which I understand why but it just makes me uncomfortable for some reason.

I had no idea it would be like that because literally no one I know how to go through that. I do NOT have a separate webcam. I'm an older student so I can't really randomly find 8 people to give presentations too. We will have speeches every week.

If I knew all this, I would have saved myself a lot of trouble and signed up for an in-person class.

I already have 3(!!!) withdrawn classes this semester so I need to decide if I want to drop the class like now. But registration is closed and I don't know if I can sign up for a different class - I am embarrassed if I wasted this semester. What should I do?!",9,3,4.416660412701743,college

My lecturer is not very bright and doesn’t explain why someone in the class is wrong,"Basically today it was one simple question which said order these in size from lowest to highest , it was bit nibble byte kilobyte megabyte gigabyte , we told him the order which is the way I’ve just write it out and he looked at the answer on his iPad (because he doesn’t know himself) and said it was wrong , now anyone that has studied a computing level of any kind even like a mini after school or college group would know that a nibble is 4 bits but when we told him this he said no it’s wrong and wouldn’t explain why it was , because he didn’t know the answer himself he just goes by the answers on his iPad and can’t explain them . This happens often such as when he said ram stores software which is incorrect as it stores instructions for the cpu to decode .

Should I transfer colleges simply because of its size?,"So I’m a first semester freshman at a really small liberal arts college(1,500 students) and I love so many things about it, except it’s too small. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about me, the academics are great, it’s in a great location, it’s very diverse, the student body is nice etc. I just can’t get past the fact that it feels like high school 2.0.

Everyone knows everyone here, all I have to say is “do you know X” and odds are, they’ll know the person if they’re in the same year as them. It’s tiresome walking through the campus and knowing 25% of the people you walk past, it feels like everything I do is being watched by someone I know and causes me a lot of anxiety because sometimes I like spending time alone and I feel like people will be judging me for being alone. Also the people are pretty dramatic and petty here, lots and lots of pointless high school drama. I don’t care about who slept with who or who gave you a dirty look, it seems pointless to me. I loved the first two weeks of college because I was constantly meeting new people, but now I pretty much know every freshman I see, at least by their face and I probably know a decent amount of information about them. I’m not sure if I want to spend the next four years barely meeting any new people.

Also I feel guilty saying this, but I don’t like that there’s no dating options. As a gay male, I’ve never had the option to date openly and not worry about discrimination, so I was looking forward to that in college. However, there’s such a small handful of gay guys here, so I feel lonely and isolated.

I plan on finishing out the semester and working my hardest, I’m just really conflicted if I’m making the right choice for the right reasons.",19,43,4.510433560849892,college

Did I smell weed or poop?,"(Note: I've never used or smelled weed before. People tell me it smells kind of skunky so that's all I really have to go off of.)

Starting a week or two ago, I've noticed a lingering poopy-farty smell in the boy's bathroom. It smells sort of like a skunky fart mixed with the slightest hint of mint? I guess the obvious answer, given that I was in a bathroom, would be that I was smelling poop & fart with some lingering floor cleaner or something, but could this also be the smell of weed? 

The reason I thought it might be weed is that 1) the way my dorm's air circulation works is that air passes between rooms, so there's a strict no-smoking-anything rule and I'm guessing the only rooms that are isolated from the rest are the bathrooms, and 2) I'm in a legal state (well technically not for another two months but it's basically legal).",8,5,4.918060875664707,college

I am functionally independent of my parents and have not been a long-term resident of my household since I left for college in August 2018- my parents do pay my auto and health insurance though and I do go home for Fall and Winter break. Would it be possible to declare some sort of financial independence from my parents so that way I could not use my parents' income and qualify for more aid? With my current situation I could probably afford basic health and auto insurance (partly through the university health insurance plan) if it was necessary since I have a job on campus. If this isn't possible, is there a way to explain this need to a financial aid officer without sounding like someone trying to make the system unfair?",3,6,5.024276153442485,college

"How many hours a week are you putting in between work, school, etc?","As in, hours where you physically have to be at whatever place it is, not counting homework. 

For me it’s:

6.5 hours of class on campus

10 hours in my research lab

24 hours at my job

So it totals out to 40.5, of course not including study time because I don’t really measure that and it varies. 

For myself, this is borderline unsustainable and pretty difficult regardless. It’s not that each of these things is super stressful (in fact lab is not at all, it’s super boring, and my job is also quite slow paced) but it’s just the simple fact of having to drag myself to each of these things and stay there for a grand total of 40 hours a week that feels like so much. Waking up early, driving, being there, the whole nine yards is just a taxing concept for me and has affected my anxiety and depression.

Should I ask a cappella groups if they need my voice part?,"Don't know if this a right sub to post this but since it's related to the social aspects rather than musical and this sub is clearly larger than r/acappella so I hope I'll get more advice here. TL;DR below.

Long story short, I'm currently a sophomore and every single semester here I've been auditioned for a cappella groups on campus. Somehow I'll find one way or another to fuck up my auditions and the best result I've ever had so far was a callback to this group last Spring, which happens to be my favorite group as well. I'm really determined for my 4th (and hopefully last) audition with this group next Spring because singing and performing is a part of my dream college life. Maybe I was influenced by *Pitch Perfect* and *Sing It On* but I really enjoy a cappella-ing. 

So here is the problem. I came to the recent concert by my favorite group to get to know more about the current-them. They had 13 people performing on stage and I believe that's all they have currently, and the guy number was 7. I happen to be a tenor as well, so I'm afraid that they won't need any more tenor (or any male voice) in the near future until their senior tenors graduate. Should I ask them if they're looking for a tenor next Spring because I may go nuts if I fail the audition again (provided that I kill it at the audition), or it's just so rude to ask that question?

Thank you guys for your time. Any advice helps!

TL;DR: Favorite a cappella group has 7 guys over 13 members. Don't know if they still need a tenor in next audition. Should I ask them or it's just rude to ask?",1,1,5.088535412701743,college

Need to transfer but scared of outcomes.,"So I'm in a dilemma and I really need advice.

I'm currently a sophomore at a Top 30 school. I've been so extremely depressed my entire duration here. When I was applying to college I really had no idea what I wanted to do in life. But after a while in freshman year i kind of figured out what I really want to do. So basically, I hate my major right now, but my school doesn't offer what I want to go into. Aside from that, some horrible things happened here to me and literally just having to be on campus I get anxiety from just thinking about my experiences. 

So right now I've decided I just need to leave this school for the sake of my sanity because I have become so insanely depressed and anxious to the point of being suicidal. I'm looking into transferring schools, but there are some problems.

The main one being that I don't want to go to a school that is ""worse"" than my current one. I know that probably sounds so stupid, but I recognize every school has their own. I just want to make sure that I will be challenged academically and not shooting myself in the foot by moving ""backwards"". So that already limits the schools I can apply to, which is anything I feel like is equal or better than my school. Which brings me to my next problem, all the top schools have extremely low acceptance rates for transfers. And I'm not even gunning for anything like harvard or yale or stanford etc. 

Andddd this brings me to my third problem, the program I want to do is pretty of niche, and a lot of the schools I would have an ok chance at (i.e. have slightly higher acceptance rates) don't have my major or anything remotely close. And if they do, it's very competitive. Like at one school, I think the overall transfer rate is like 15%, but for my major it's 4% which is ridiculously competitive. So at this point there are only 4 schools that I think would be academically challenging for me and also offer my major, and they are all extremely competitive.

Here's where I need advice, if this whole transfer thing doesn't work out for me I literally don't think I could last any longer at my current school. I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid to myself just because college is making me so insanely miserable. Should I take a gap year or something? Should I just force myself through two more years? Should I just get off my high horse and apply to some safety schools?",4,5,5.238882634923966,college
Unsatisfied with my advisors plan to graduation,"I’m a non traditional student I’ve been in school on/off for various reasons since 2013. I’m tired of being in school and I want to hurry up and graduate ASAP.

Roommate trouble,"I moved into the room and it was empty the first two weeks until my university assigned me a roommate.

I’m in my third year of college- never had such a workload from a professor. Suggestions,"Hello everyone. I’m in my 3rd year of college. I’ve always kept straight A’s all through my college education. I take online courses full time and work full time but I find it really important to prioritize my school work. I’m a very independent student. I never feel out of touch with my school work and have never really felt overloaded on my homework unless I took a speed course. 

This semester I feel like I may have gotten the most inconsiderate professor I’ve ever had. I say inconsiderate because she loads us up on so much homework, extra assignments, and quizzes that I actually have mental breakdowns every week over her class alone. 

Her school week consists of only 6 days. An example of my course work each week(6 days) is 2 individual chapters of work.. included in that is: 1 LearnSmart each chapter... 91 questions each... that’s almost 200 questions. Then we are assigned 1 extra “assignment” to demonstrate the work for each chapter at 30 questions each with sub parts to each question... that’s 60 questions not including the sub parts. Then we have a quiz for each chapter with 20 questions each... that’s 40 timed questions. She added a research assignment that is due in 3 weeks without letting up on any of the work for the next 3 weeks. She told us we have to “find time between assignments to do that”. No thanksgiving break even though my school is closed. If we want a break we have to “double up on assignments for a week or two”. Which I find absolutely impossible considering I’m already drowning in my work from this class. 

A couple things to add: 
* She does not open up chapters ahead of the week’s assignment. So you cannot work ahead in this class. 
* I contacted other classmates privately and we are all in agreement that this workload is impossible, but we don’t know what we can do about it.
* Yes, I do take other classes which makes this matter even worse.

Secondary Voice Lessons: I take the bus to the music school once per week to have a lesson 

Clubs: 
ROC Players: This is the main theatre troupe. I’m in the main show, which sucks up a bunch of time. 
OBOC: This is a theatre group that just does singular numbers. It’s a lot more low key than OBOC. I’ll probably drop it next semester

How do i complain nicely about other suites?,"So, I am a freshman and everything in my hall has been perfect. Except the boys below us. Not only do they smoke weed INSIDE, but they play LOUD music way past silence hours (11pm). 

I understand that it is college and sometimes you wanna party, but it is barely the second week and have not been able to sleep because of them. 

I tried asking them to quiet down by sending a text on the hall’s gc, but i just heard them laugh and pumped the music even louder. They didn’t shut up until like 2am, when the girls next to us started stomping on the ground.

My school has a stereotype of being “socially dead” and i really don’t want to contribute to that, but also, i am paying thousands of dollars to attend here, and I don’t want to be dead on my 8ams just because of some dumb boys

I know complaining to my RA’s is an option, but they are never there on their office hours, and they live on the same floor as these boys, so i feel like they’ve given up trying to enforce the rules. What can i do to tell them to shut the fuck up???

Tldr: Boys below me play loud ass music at around 11pm-2am every single day and I don’t know how to tell them to shut the fuck up",2,1,5.481891894183225,college

What are your thoughts on professors curving for exams?,"I know I'm going to be very biased towards saving my own GPA at the moment, so I wanted to get other people's opinions. I had an exam where I felt like I did okay, but at the same time, I feel like the professor was being a real hardass. She's not a particularly good lecturer, and the stuff that most people got wrong on the exam was the stuff that she did not include in her slides or in the readings. And I attended every class too; I just think it's unreasonable to expect people to remember everything without anything written to reference back to! (Yes, one can take notes, but she's pretty all over the place.)

So, the average ended up being 76%, and I feel like she should've scaled, if even only to make the average 80%. Thoughts?",8,1,5.545364116405447,college
College and working through it are killing my mental health. I’m going to fail at least one of my classes. What should I do?,"To summarize, I’m in 4 classes. I am most likely going to fail class A, will maybe fail class B, am going to achieve a lower grade than I’d like in C and will probably do fine in D.

I was homeless and I am not any more but I am really afraid to be again. I have bad mental illness. I was working two jobs when I started school and was going to quit job 2 when my school money came in, but my school money hasn’t come in yet and so I’ve been working like 40-60 hours a week in addition to being a full time student and it’s been shitty. I haven’t been able to buy books so I’ve been using the ones in the library which isn’t open 24/7 and so that also limits my ability to succeed.

I skip class really often. I just get anxious about whatever, like seeing the professor and them knowing I’m not good enough to be there or whatever else shit I can’t get out of my head and I don’t go. Sometimes I get 40 minutes past when I should leave and then I do manage to go and I cry after but I go. I also have trouble participating in class or paying attention because I have ADHD with everything else going on

When I get really stressed I get really paranoid thinking like everything is a test (like that my jobs are testing me, my friends are testing me, etc to determine if I deserve to be treated like a Person) and it gets out of hand and I do a lot of crazy shit I shouldn’t. I’m pretty ok at handling it with my jobs and not being crazy super often. I think because I had a learning disability when I was a kid and I got bullied for it the classroom environment exacerbates things also.

I’m trying to do nursing and I’m not even in the program yet. I feel totally fucked about it and I don’t know what to do. I really do enjoy working on my feet at fast paced jobs and I love science especially labs, so I think I’ll be ok once I graduate.

TLDR my brain don’t big work so good, and it’s big not work so good especially because I’m working so much. I’m not doing good in my classes and I don’t know what to do.",7,20,5.5470423571461875,college

What to do with my life?,"Ok. Young mint was a fool. I was undiagnosed, un-treated, depressed with high anxiety engaged at 21 that didn’t a flying fuck about school. 
I messed up and left to get married with a 1.76 GPA.
Since then, mint has gotten divorced, and has grown up to a 28 year old who, managed to go back to the same school and raise the GPA to a 2.07 WHILE dealing with: 
a.) the fact I had to feel in the middle of the night from ex-husband fearing for her life. 
b.) my mother diagnoses and then death from cancer 
c.) two jobs
d.) intensive 8 hour 2 month long therapy
All this while I was going back to school. I jumped right back into it because hey I fucked up and need to get on this shit. 
I’ve taken 5 classes so far. I have 64 credits. (I told you I fucked up.)
So, my potential is there. Please don’t say am I sure I can handle a 4-year college.

So, with that being said, I can actually graduate from college this coming spring with my associates if I want.
I MIGHT be graduating with a 2.3 
Now, I want to transfer to a 4 year in pursuit of a degree in education. I live in PA.
I’m trying to figure out what to do. So far with the few colleges I’ve looked into, I need a 3.0.
I’ve had the suggestion to transfer into a major that requires a lower GPA, maintain a 3.0 and then transfer majors after my first year/semester.

I have some other options:
I can re-take some of my previous classes. I am no longer eligible for Financial aid. I CAN however appeal this. Try to bump up my GPA.
I can graduate and then re-apply to a new community college, have financial aid, and earn another 2 year degree. NOW I don’t know if said colleges I would want to transfer to would look at both my graduating GPAs?
I can cry. 
I’ve done that enough hahaha.

"I need advice about these 2 particular subjects, Its just my first year and i feel like im already failing.","This will be my very first post so go easy on me guys haha. Im half filipino and half egyptian, the reason why im saying this is because ive spent half of my life in egypt(kindergarten to grade 7) where ive never learned tagalog. I came here to the Philippines due to personal reasons and started school here from grade 8 til 1st year of college, And now im at my first year of college taking BSIT here in the Philippines and there are 2 minor subjects that are in tagalog. They would be using the most deepest terms that not even my classmates could understand but lucky for them they're used to it they can pick it up easily, by translating them into simpler terms, or they actually are familiar with these terms since they have taken it in high school. meanhwile for me i kept on failing on my quizzes, barely making it with my activities, and now that its my midterms, i dont think ill be able to pass it. Both of these subjects are history related and its my weakness, ive always failed history subjects even if it was in arabic or English, I'd still fail it. I honestly dont know how i made it this far.

I know people experience failures in their life but for me if i fail these midterms i dont think ill be able to pass my finals. The teachers know my situation that im not really fluent in tagalog. But i wanted to know if there are other people out there who are not fluent in the country's language and are having the same struggles as me. I feel really alone when it comes to this because all my classmates are filipinos. I just wanted to read how people solve this problem. 

I am abit fluent in the language (conversational and reading) but when it comes to the subject itself, im having a hard time with it. My question is if you're in the same situation as me how do you solve it? Ive tried translating into simpler terms but its very time consuming and at the end nothings ends up entering my head. I know these are minor subjects but i have this weight on my back that if i fail like what happened to my sister, my father will be very disappointed. And no one wants to disappoint their parents, well for me that this the case.",1,1,5.614391894183225,college

I’m choosing me in College,"So I’m not sure if I’m writing this in the correct subreddit but here it goes. So ever since I started college I had this idea that success=impressing others. If you’re not majoring in x,y and z then you will be a failure and I fell for that myth. So I would look to double major (Math/Econ or Stat) and even at times try to even triple major (Math/Stat/economics while trying to tack on a comp sci). As a result I would have to study/work literally the 12 hours a day because I was taking like 3-4 intense courses with 1-2 courses not as challenging but still a course nonetheless. I would get good grades but at the cost of not being able to spend time with my friends and family. Not going to the gym and losing much of the muscle I gained prior to college. After 2 years of that, I reflected on myself and realized I wasn’t living. So after those 2 years I decided to choose me. Choose happiness. Choose my friends/family. Choose my health. So I decided to just pick one major and a minor. I posted this to not only share some feelings but to give some guidance to others going through that struggle. 

Now I’m not saying that nobody should double major, not at all. But if you find other parts of your life deteriorating and/or you don’t have a genuine interest in the subjects, then it may not be worth it. It might seem like common knowledge but it really isn’t, at least where I’m from.",2,8,5.712181246035078,college

What happens if you don't like the job that your degree prepared you for?,"I studied STEM for five years to get a Masters in Computer Science (scholarship), and I've been working now for two years as a Software Developer.

In those two years of working, I've found out that I hate working in the area with a passion.

Oh, I still love writing code and programming. But working in a company: there's something about taking something I love, a hobby, a passion, and seeing it corrupted by company people that just want to use it for money and only care about low-ball budgets and deadlines. 

Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it. The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do. Everything is REST APIs these days. And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just viewed.

I hate my life now, and I can't understand how it turned out this way.

What can I do? I can't just go back to university and choose another career. I have adult responsibilities with adult-sized bills now. 

I seem to be locked in to a life that isn't mine and I don't want. That's what I got from attending college.",4,3,5.744739116405448,college

Would this be annoying to my professor?,"So last semester I took a class that studied 19th century american utopias that I absolutely loved.

The professor was really great and I liked him a lot. I joined his club and am currently taking another class with him. Anyways, I recently bought a newspaper on eBay that dates back to 1866 from the same commune that we slept over at. I was planning on hanging it up in my room and having it serve as some type of memorabilia conversation piece, but before hanging it up, I was considering showing my professor the newspaper as I think he’ll find it interesting and fun to read. Would it be annoying and would I come off as a “try hard” or “suck-up” to bring him the newspaper to look at during his office hours, or do you think he would enjoy looking at it?

I just got hired at target a few days ago and it‘s my first job so what I’m gonna do is to work to get job experience. Obviously it won’t be my life job.

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",2,0,6.216220597886929,college

Nice apartments, close to main street - $650 a month 

Nice apartments, far far far far from main street extra inconvenient - $400 a month

Meh quality apartments, close to main street - $500 a month 

My 2 friends who I want to room with and are apartment searching with me are going for the $650. My mom refuses to pay more than $500, and I'm definitely not going for the far apartments so I'm trying to go for the $500 ones.

But anything that comes up that they don't like in those apartments when we live there, they'll always be reminded of the fact that I'm the reason they're there and they could be having something better. 

What should I do? 

\- I don't know how to convince my mom. See, I'm pretty much going to college at the mercy of my parents so I feel like I don't have any right to ask for more money than they're willing to pay. I spend a total of $0 dollars on anything not school related and I only eat using my meal plan right now. I'm trying to find a job during the spring semester so I can earn spending money. I had like $100 to spend but my mom visited last weekend and took my cash back home so that kinda demonstrates how stingy she is.

\- I could convince my friends to get the $500, although I'd feel guilty for everything wrong with the apartment and I'd have to live with that

Transferring senior year,"First time on this sub, delete if not allowed. 

I could really use some advice. I'm extremely upset right now. I go to DePaul University as an education student. I am a senior, set to finish all courses by Spring 2020 and do student teaching Fall 2020. 

I have six courses left. 

Due to a scheduling error on both my and the university's part, I have just found out that I needed to take a class that is only offered fall term. All courses must be completed before student teaching, so this means that my student teaching would be deferred to Winter 2021. This is not a viable option for me for many reasons, the main one being I am set to move across the country immediately after student teaching. For financial reasons, I would not be able to not make this move at this time. 

Basically, I am in communication with my school to see if there's anything I  can do about the credit. In the meantime I am considering other options, like transferring to a school in the area I would be moving to. 

Are senior year transfers even a thing? Is there any hope? I've read online that most schools will only accept students with junior standing and below, but I'm willing to re take classes if that's what it takes.

Can you report teachers who keep emailing/harassing you?,"I have been going back and forth with a college professor.

I tried saying ""I have dropped out of your class"" aka saying it's my last email and I just wanted to explain everything. I told her thank you for the time in your class and I was hoping that'd be it. 

THEN he emails me again going on and on / putting me down and that's when I put my foot down and countered her points and said I was blocking her since I had no need to ever talk to her again. 

Then I blocked her.

I was getting increasingly worried if she would try to message me on a different email and continue to harass me via emails. Could I report her if this occurs? I don't want to argue with a 40-50 year old teacher who should be grown enough to calm down and just be in a respectful discussion with another student.

400 level class as a freshman?,"I recently joined an environmental club on campus, and we had two advisors from the journalism department come and tell us about this class they're offering this spring and next fall. It's a really cool eco journalism course that does a lot of hands on work with connecting our state to the global dialogue on climate change. You can only take the class if you're one of the 20 accepted applicants, so I've been working on that (includes a resume, essay, and work sample).

They said they're looking for passionate students for the class, and that it doesn't necessarily matter if you have journalism experience or not (which seemed a little odd to me, but each to their own). I told my advisor about it in a meeting today and she basically just went on about how it probably won't be a good fit and how she'd never put a freshman in a 400 level course, going on about how incredibly difficult it would be. She didn't outright say not to apply for it, but was strongly discouraging me from signing up for it (assuming I even get accepted).

However, I did have a lot of experience with high school counselors greatly overestimating the difficulty of course loads, and/or underestimating me. There were definitely counselors who thought taking like 3 AP classes at once was impossible to balance, even though I took 7 each semester of senior year and was perfectly fine. I'm almost wondering if this is similar to the mindset my advisor has.

Has anyone taken a 400 level class as a freshman? Is it doable? Is my advisor being dramatic, or should I listen to her? This sounds like an amazing opportunity, and I was an editor for the school paper in high school. Obviously, this doesn't mean I'm as experienced as a journalism major, and I doubt high school journalism is nearly as rigorous as that at the college level, but some familiarity with design programs and knowledge of journalism kind of puts me over their lack of requirement for experience. Should I even apply? I have no clue if I'd get in, but my advisor was making it sound like I was crazy for even considering the class.",4,3,6.499912727516558,college

I was happy they got As and I controlled my own grade 100%.

Regretting Transferring,"Hi all,

I did my freshman year at Montana State University. I applied for transfer to UW Madison (in my home state) during my first semester because I found my classes to be too easy, and many of my peers to be disengaged/not academically minded. Additionally the psychology department (I'm a psych major) at Montana pales in comparison to the one at UW Madison.

Second semester I found some really close friends and really got to exploring Montana. I was physically active and really on top of my school work. It actually felt good to have work to do. I also started taking more challenging classes. I've had chronic depression almost my whole life and for the first time, that second semester, it really went away.

I spent summer in Madison to try and meet people/""get my foot in the door."" This was a mistake. Nobody was my age (people here mostly just go out to 21+ bars for fun), and I fell into a lonely deep depression. I moved back to my hometown for August. I realized I wasn't excited to go back to Madison, but I'd give it a try.

I feel stuck in Montana. I don't particularly dislike Madison, (Idk how much I like the excessive drinking culture though) but all I can think about is how amazing it was in Montana. I remember the day before I left feeling sad that I was leaving all my friends and this amazing place. I realized I would have been okay/happy with staying there. I feel like I can't connect with anyone/give Madison a chance because I don't want to leave Montana behind.

Sorry for the long post. Should I stay in Madison, or transfer back to Bozeman?

Montana State: Tuition with academic scholarship (which I might not get back) $12,000. Where I have close friends, enjoy living, enjoy the adventurous culture, and could excel amongst my peers. 
UW Madison: Tuition is $10,000. Where I have some high school friends, don't mind living, dislike the work-hard play-hard drinking culture, and there are many good research opportunities and connections in psychology.

Thanks guys.",2,1,6.849403468257298,college

Proctor U error resulted in me missing final exam,"Exam is worth 15% of course grade. The exam was on proctor u, and is in a pre-req science course. I had logged into proctor u normally and did a system check, and my computer and internet connection passed the check. However, when it came to opening the proctor chat box, I got a blank box. Although a proctor was connected, I cannot communicate with the proctor as I cannot see the messages because the proctor chat box wasn't working. I was talking with customer service trying to resolve the issue, but by the time I finished, the exam's deadline had already passed.  


My professor's policy is that she will allow makeups if it was proctor u's fault, but not if it is my fault or I had internet issues. She contacted proctor U and they said my internet connection was weak and I refused to communicate with the proctor. My internet connection passed their system check, and I was also taking the exam at my University Library. And I couldn't respond to the proctor cause the proctor's chat was blank.   


Do you think I'm in the wrong or proctor U is in the wrong, or somewhere in the middle. I did everything under my control to make sure my computer met the requirements, including passing the system, check.

Need 2k by December-any potential grants/scholarships?,"I’m a freshman in college this year. 

My tuition and fees are covered by a scholarship I have so all I need to pay are my meal plan and housing. I used FAFSA and got 2,750 each semester and have an additional 1,200 from the Pell Grant.

Advice for getting into a good university with bad community college grades,"I’m going to try to summarize as much as possible: When I graduate HS in 2015, I took a year break due to my mental health issues (I have debilitating mental illness(es)). When I attempted to take some community college classes the year after, I started off great but shortly after my mental illness kicked in and I was unable to focus on school work and getting to school on time, therefore making many of my grades not so good (some Bs, Cs, and dropouts). Because of my grades I lost access to the financial aid I was provided. Even though I felt like I grasped the material I was learning and could produce good results, I just wasn’t in the right headspace (I had an English teacher say I would have passed the class with flying colors if I would have attended more frequently). Anyways, fast forward to now- I’m doing a lot better and have changed a lot about my mindset and goals. How do I start from here? I have some interest, as a 22 year old, to build back my grades and transcript but where should I continue, especially since I have my sights set on attending a university soon (within the next year or a half). Any suggestions would be amazing. Thanks for reading!

How to deal with a difficult professor?,"So planning out my next semester, and I gotta take a class with a professor who is absolutely, according to everyone in the major, the absolute worse professor anyone has had. The guy is, pardon my French, a straight up asshole.

On the first day of class, he said straight up that as a professor his objective is to try his best to fail the students and the students have to do there best to beat him. 

My question: how the hell do I deal with this? I need one more semester to graduate, and I need to take this class to graduate.

I feel guilty for saying I’m a first generation college student,"I’m a student at a UC school and I’ve gotten some really great research opportunities - partially I believe because I have been filling out my applications saying I’m a first generation college student and have received the pell grant.

While the rest of my family is decently educated, neither of my parents finished college. However after they divorced my dad remarried when I was 8 to a woman who teaches high school English and later got her PhD in education (or something like that) online. I split time equally between my parents evenly growing up. Since I was on my moms taxes I also qualified for financial aid my first two years of community college until she got remarried as well (also someone with a degree). 

Since these applications ask me the education level of my parents (with space only for 2) and if I have received any financial aid while in college I answer the questions honestly... but I still feel like I’m cheating or lying since there are probably other students whose situations better reflect the meaning of a low income/first generation student and I may be stealing these opportunities.

"Lost in life... want to be creative for a living, but money issues imminent... (Money vs Passion, sort of?)","Title. **No simple TL;DR, read if you’re willing.** This is a long post, but very, deeply important to me.

So basic info: live in Cali, Central Valley. Currently finishing an AA for Transfer in English. At the risk of tooting my own horn too much, my grades are great and make me very desirable. And I have an okay bit of extracurricular stuff and decent essay skills to make a good application to all but the most top-tier colleges.

If you want to know what my passion is, what makes me happy and joyful in life: writing. At the moment it’s mostly limited to fanfiction, but I have found a profound love of storytelling. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been fascinated by stories, by making them up, finding them in odd places, just being creative in general. I can’t properly type out how deep this passion runs. Of course, I would love to start working on original stuff as well.

**To get this out of the way: what’s my ultimate career goal?** To one day be the head writer of (thing). Said thing could be anything from TV shows, to web shows (Think Rooster Teeth sort of web shows), video games, possibly movies, etc. The stuff that I grew up on. Just to be a creative lead/head writer for an original IP for me would be a glorious dream come true.

So the issue? Sort of a money v passion thing.

I have no fucking clue where to go from here. As of me typing this it is Oct. 7, and College applications here in Cali run from Oct 1 to Nov 30. I won’t bore you with my life story but: I am sick and tired of this hometown. Its… fine, but I want out. I graduated in 2016, I’ve waited long enough, i’m tired of failing (I’ve been to college before, long story as to what failed). I want to get it right this time. I can’t stand another year living here, partly due to financial reasons. That is off the table.

I’m looking for advice as to how to proceed here, from anybody who can help. The truth is, my financial situation is not great, I can’t keep relying on my parents much longer. I desperately need to be able to sustain myself, and to get a career where I can get by without constantly asking for money.

The money option: I’ve always liked planes and birds and just aerodynamical stuff, so early on in my life, engineer was an interesting career option. Maybe designing flying things of some sort, or vehicles, since I do love fast cars. And aero engineers are something usually in pretty high demand, so I’m confident that with dedication, this could land me a nice job and sustain me. 

The passion option: Engineering is fine, tolerable, but it would never truly bring me happiness or satisfaction in my existence. In my life, I’ve found that when I truly feel amazing and fulfilled as a human being is when I publish a story people like, or one where people take the time to comment and critique. This is what drives me, this is what makes me feel alive and meaningful. So studying for a writing degree of some kind seems good. Maybe Screenwriting, or is that too limited to film? Is Creative Writing too vague? No idea, but something along those lines. To just fully embrace this passion and go find a career in it.

Bullet points:

-Engineer almost guarantees (with enough dedication) a well-paying career, Writing does not. Especially in CA, very saturated market, lots of financial instability. I don’t want to die both penniless AND with broken dreams.
-Like I mentioned, I love to write, but it’s a very “Raw” skill atm. It’s not terrible, I don’t think, but I’m someone who excels when I have some sort of guidance/a teacher. Hence why I usually do great at school. Having instruction to refine my skills is where I do my absolute best.

-Why study engineering? Well… it’s going to be difficult to get a job in such a high-tech field without a degree, isn’t it? And again, pays pretty decently.

-Why study writing? Many famous writers don’t at all have degrees, so why study it in college? Because to me, college would have two functions: One, to refine my raw skill into something polished and exceptional. Two, and perhaps most critically: help me connect and network. Help me start to get a foot in that industry, help me meet people I can network with, get my name out there as a promising student, get those internships, get maybe some freelance work, which can turn into a professional career, where I could one day pitch my own ideas to people who now know me.

So there. I’m utterly torn, and I’ve got two months to decide. I want, with all my heart, to pursue this passion, but I need financial stability, my parents aren’t getting any younger and can’t keep helping for much longer. I’ve got no idea what kind of degree to pursue, what career paths I have, just this distant dream that is the sum of all I’ve desired, of what makes me feel happy and fulfilled. But in a world this cold and harsh… money makes it go around, and I can’t be the struggling artist living off his parents.

This haunts my every waking hour as the decision looms. No idea what I can do, what I should do. I’ve tried to talking to 2 or 3 academic counselors, but most give very general or vague advice. They’re focused on getting me into a college: it’s a bit hard to describe this huge life story and my long-term concerns.

If you made it through this, you’re an amazing person, thank you. Not used to people caring this much about my problems.

Summary questions:

-Money or passion?
-If I chose money, what could I do to also further my writing career/education at the same time?
-If I chose passion, what kind of jobs could a degree in writing (And more important, the networking I could do in college) get me? Something sustainable, or something that could be a step to my eventual goal I mentioned?

I’ll try to answer any questions you have as soon as I can, so shoot.",5,1,7.260977542331374,college
Changing Majors: Electrical Engineering to Psychology,"Hey guys,

I am a rising sophomore at the University of Maine and I am currently studying Electrical Engineering. Over the past few months (including previous semesters), my interest in this subject has been dwindling away and I really felt like I was on a path to a career that I wouldn't be interested in. Recently, I have been doing some real thinking, and I believe I am finally ready to make a switch.

Psychology has always been something I've been interested in. While I wouldn't go as far as to call it a passion, I definitely think it would a much better fit for me. I understand that careers in that field don't pay nearly as much as one in EE would, but I am honestly okay with that. I've never really been one to live outside my means. 

All this of course leads to a few questions:

Would making such a drastic change in my major look bad on my college transcript?

I have taken several math, chemistry, and physics classes, I know it depends on the school, but would any of those be useful?

Would old high school AP credits also transfer?

Is it hard to find a decent paying job with a ?masters degree in psychology?

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the density of this post, but there is just so much uncertainty.

Do you prefer making group projects with friends or with classmates you don't know?,"Hey,

I just wanted to ask this sub something, based on your opinion or personal experience.

**What do you think about sticking with friends you already know when you have a group project** vs. **doing it with other classmates you don't know at all**? Can you share your experience, any little stories?

Personally I prefer making a group with people I don't know. After my first year where I teamed up with a friend, I realized friends can be very annoying in group projects. My friend didn't know how to calculate a simple average, asked me to ""just tell her everything she has to do and she will do it"" and when I did, she understood the literal opposite of what I asked her to do. When it was about the project it was easy for us to get mad at each other, so obviously we probably would've been better off if we were in different groups for the remaining time of our friendship.

Honestly I wish any of my group projects we were randomly assigned to groups. I recently had to make/join a group again and my closest college friends quickly asked me to join them. I dodged them until I joined a group to claim ""I'm already taken"", mostly because I know them and I think they don't work hard enough or they're not passionate enough about the subject. They're not bad people, it's just that.

At least if I get teammates that don't work hard now, it'll be a stranger and I could just cut contact after the project is done and I won't have anyone to blame except my luck. I also love getting to know new people, and group projects are a perfect opportunity for that. The only ""hard"" part is that I have to approach classmates and ask if they want to form a group.",3,1,7.303813190479521,college

How to have a discussion with a professor about class expectations,"Come context: I am currently taking Physics 2 under a professor who is new to the university (not new to teaching though) and on probation (since 50% of her students last semester scored a 60% or under) something I knew ahead of time but since she's the only professor teaching it so there wasn't anyway around it. It became very clear to me as to why so many struggled as within the first lecture her general disorganization and ineffective explanations of already challenging subjects made it impossible to understand what was happening. Since that first day I knew I was going to need to fire on all cylinders to pass this class. I spent a lot of time outside of class trying to absorb the material by reading the text book, watching videos and attending tutoring almost every day. I did all the homework legitimately (which alone took about 20 hours per assignment) and was really giving this class everything. I had met other students and discussed their experience in the class and they all described almost identical experiences to mine. But, we buckled down and formed a study group to coordinate our efforts in an attempt to streamline our learning experience. We all seriously prepared for our first midterm but it seemed almost futile in retrospect as no one I know felt remotely okay about the exam. Some left entire pages blank it was so much more difficult than what we had seen prior. I feel like my group and I did everything we could to prepare for this exam and we all still probably failed. Unfortunately, she is not a believer in curves.

Now with that out of the way, I would like to ask how to go about having a conversation with the professor about her expectations for this class. There is no syllabus for this class, which makes this challenging. I was planning on emailing her to see if we could arrange a time to meet one on one to discuss how to be successful in her class. Though, I honestly don't trust myself not to just rant about it since I feel like I've already done everything I could have done. Should I tell her everything I said above (obviously remove anything that could personally offend her)? How do I do that without sounding overly negative/critical of her teaching? I feel like if I just straight up ask her how to be successful I'll just get the same answer she told us the first day, ""This class is really like a part time job, treat it as such."" which I've already been doing with little success.

Any thoughts how to go about this productively?

"My roommate has his girlfriend over every day and I don't know how to approach him about limiting it, can someone give me some advice?","So I've been in college for a little over a month now and since the first night I moved in, I could probably count the number of nights my roommate's girlfriend wasn't here on one hand. I think she's a cool person but lately they've started spending pretty much every available second in our room, and lately it's really been getting on my nerves that I don't seem to have any personal space. Me and my roommate aren't that close and we don't talk a whole bunch and I really don't want to come across as a controlling dick but I feel like since she doesn't pay for our room she isn't entitled to be here as much as she is. She's also there when he's not and lately I think they've been skipping class so they can lay in bed together all day. Also I went home over the weekend and when I came back this weekend my blankets were not how I leave them, there was some substance on my desk (I think it was mayo) that I didn't leave there, and some of my stuff was pushed off to the side so her laptop could be there. So I'm also starting to feel disrespected. I just don't know how to approach this. (Also side note: a couple weeks ago I had to talk to him about not having sex when im there since there was multiple times I got woken up by them fucking, I don't know if I needed to include that but I figured it might give some insight into my situation. Im just really starting to get at my wits end about this and I don't know what to do.

Should I feel guilty for having my education paid for?,"I want to preface this by saying I'm not looking for pity. I understand that I'm extremely fortunate and am only looking for feedback, even if I don't like it. 

My parents aren't outrageously wealthy, but they've managed to save enough to cover all of my expenses at an in state school for 4 years. I work during the summers and am looking for part time work during the year in hopes of covering my housing independently, but it's just to ease my conscience. If I wanted, I could fuck around for 4 years on their dollar.

I'm trying my absolute best to make the most of this gift, but I feel incredibly guilty for having been dealt such a good hand. I hate that there are smart people out there who will never realize their potential because they don't have what I do. I also feel like it invalidates my success. I was considered smart in high school and have managed to maintain a high GPA in college, but I can't help but wonder if these things would still be true if I were poor. Do I deserve any credit for my success? Or do I owe it to a reduced pool of competition and a home environment conducive to academic advancement?  Do I have anything to feel bad about?

That being said, can anyone offer perspective? Is there something I haven't considered in this, or am I right?",10,2,7.355005320109151,college
Drop from biology bachelors for associates degree? Are associates degrees useful? Other options?," I'm currently a sophomore (third semester here) and I'm stressed of everything. I'm doing biology bachelors with ecology concentrations (which I hear from most other people is pretty much a useless degree, so I've been considering dropping out despite my love for nature and wildlife).

Here's the deal: I most likely see myself dropping out or doing something else later down the line because I simply can't see myself doing another 3-4 years of this. At the same time, I don't want to live in an apartment within a trashy ghetto. I'm not asking for a huge salary, all I want is a small house of my own within a decent, non-trashy neighborhood (I want to move out of my current state, somewhere nice and quiet, away from any big cities), with a job I atleast semi-enjoy (tolerate). I'll probably live alone but my brother and I may end up being roommates if we actually agree on a place/find jobs close to eachother.

Question is, what am I supposed to do? I wouldn't mind finding an associates degree or trade for something I'm interested in as long as it won't just be another useless degree. Are associates degrees even worth anything? I see some people say they're about as useful as a liberal arts degree and others say it's the best decision they've ever made, making great salaries. Or should I just drop out and hope to god I can find a decent paying job with no degree?

**TLDR;** Fed up with college (doing biology bachelors currently). Is it worth dropping this to pursue an associates degree? If so, which degrees are both interesting/enjoyable and make enough money to move out and buy a house of my own (nothing fancy or big, I just want one in a good neighborhood at least)?

What is a professional relationship with professors?,"Hello, other college Redditors! I'm having trouble with my English education degree, the issue is that I feel lost in my 2nd-year of school. I've been homeschooled up until high school where I took 2 years of community college classes. I was excited to be in college where I might have a lot of people to talk to and help me learn more about the profession that I wanted to go into. Social anxiety has hindered my ability to make close friends of my peers, and so I was wondering if my professors would be someone I could reach out to discuss what it means to be an English instructor. 

I've been called a suck-up before, as I feel comfortable talking to adults rather than peers of my own age, but I don't want to be a suck-up.

Homesick Sophomore,"I'm about six weeks into my sophomore year of college and I still feel homesick. It's at its peak when I come back from a weekend at home and lasts about four to five days before tapering off. During this time though, I feel unmotivated, antisocial, anxious, and depressed. 

I know this is probably a normal thing to feel after spending time at home, but I just wanted to put my thoughts into words. A weird habit I need to get out of is always wanted to be elsewhere. That is: when I am at college, I am dying to go home. I carry on with my daily tasks, but internally I have a ""clock/countdown"" until the next time that I can leave. Finally, when it is that time to leave to go home for the weekend, I get a little sad because I feel like I am missing out. Once at home, I have to convince myself that it was a good idea to leave for a bit. 

I don't know if this is normal, but I just feel as if I'm caught in a state of limbo. I never feel like I fully can settle into where I am at.

Physics vs Chemistry,"Hello

I’d like to hear the opinions of someone knowledgeable on the matter of Physics vs Chemistry as a major. 



I find “conceptual physics” incredibly interesting. I love watching YouTube videos, reading pop-science books on physics,... basically, I’m an “armchair physicist”. I’m absolutely garbage at maths, unfortunately. 


I’m not as interested in chemistry, but it’s the next best thing for me, I guess. My uni is really soft on maths in chemistry, so it more of a realistic goal for me. 


I’ve already finished a bachelors in humanities, so I have the “maturity” required to study hard and independently. I now have one year before the start of the next school year, of which I have some free time to study maths.


Do you think I should swallow my pride and accept that the maths aspect of physics is too much for me, and go for chemistry, which is less interesting to me?",6,3,7.657296986775817,college

As I am writing resumés and CVs right now, I am requested to put down my grades and performances, modules related to the field, etc etc. However I have limited things to show in regards of software and programming.

What should I do? I need help.,"I have this problem where I was not able to do my national high school Equivalency to apply for local colleges, and that requires me to do 7 SAT subject tests (I am not American) . I did 6 and I tried to do the 7th before graduation, which was an AP exam, but I failed the test and was late. my only option was to take the last SAT test that they had available and that I took classes for in High school , which was World History . 

Now I did not take that exam in May or June because I was not ready and didn't study for it, and now the closest day for the test is in December, and that became my plan. 

But a chance for me to study in a military college came up from a government program that they do to hire people in the military in positions that they need. So if they need engineers, they would send a very limited number of students to study engineering in these military colleges in the United States. They required the student to speak English well and had Intrest in working with the military. I applied, and they required me to get them an equivalency, which I was working on. But I was also required to do an SAT with assay test and a TOEFL exam. 

Here comes the Issue, the only registration date for the SAT was In December, the same date which I was planning on taking World History to do the equivalency, and I can't take both exams on the same day, which meant that I had to change my plan and take another exam which is U.S History in November, which Is a very short time period to study for a subject that I didn't take classes for and know nothing about, Just so I could continue with my military college application. 

Or I could ditch my chance to apply for the military college, and just go with the first plan and apply for a regular University locally. 

Keep in mind that I worked very hard and went with all the procedures required for my US military college application, and it would be a waste of money and time if I decide to not take the required exams.

So what should I do? Take the World History test in December and just do the equivalency and apply for a local University? 
Or push my self to study the U.S history test in November, which is one month from now, and also do both the SAT and TOEFL exams?",1,2,7.784565505294336,college
College changed major requirements in the midst of me applying,"So I’ve been sitting in the marketing major at my school but I’ve been taking the required classes for the analytics major which is a new major within the business school. All business majors have the same foundation courses so I’ve been taking those + in addition to one class this quarter that contributes towards my economics minor. As of spring quarter, I was told I needed to get a B or higher in my statistics class in which I’ve earned a B+ and then fill out a change of major form to get into the analytics major. Now, I filled out the form when this school year started and definitely before this past Thursday when they sent out the email to every business student about how the requirements to get into analytics have changed. Now it is required that you must pass calculus with a B or higher, I failed calculus at school but I passed business calculus at a community college over the summer with a B so I received credit for it. The second requirement is that I need to get a B or higher in my statistics class, in which I got a B+. Finally, the final requirement is that my gpa must be a 3.0 or above. My gpa is a 2.87 and this is likely to rise to a 3.0 or above by the end of this quarter. I struggled a lot during my freshman year and I’m recovering from that by learning how to study effectively and so far that’s been an upward trend as I went from probation to dean’s list. This definitely raises a red flag for those who will view my application because I’m not even meeting the gpa requirement. In the email sent out, it says that even if you meet the requirements, it doesn’t mean you can start the analytics classes/be accepted this year. I am currently a junior with no room to fit extra classes or to stay another two years due to financial aid. I am trying to graduate by next year and I just feel so lost with all this change going on. I’m meeting with my advisor tomorrow to see what I can do but my argument is that I pretty much met the requirements (and turned in the change of major form)  before this new requirement information was made public.

Anyway, she said no at first because of her busy schedule but she said she could be convinced. I had basically decided right there and then that I was not going to try to inconvenience her, and was going to give up. But she kept prodding, trying to get me to convince her and was telling me that I needed to put my water bottle down (I was fidgeting), straighten my back, and gain some confidence, and that I was never going to be able to talk to the faculty, with the way I was doing. She made these comments in the nicest way possible and I know she was just trying to give me realistic advice and have me face the truth but I couldn't help but feel like I was being insulted. I started tearing up on her and she could probably tell. Once I left her office, I immediately started hyperventilating and sobbing for 45 minutes. People always say to visit office hours and that the professors are harmless, but after this experience, I never want to step foot in an office again. I'm obviously not prepared for university and its professionalism as I never gained an ounce of determination and self-respect over the years.

How can I get better grades when I am overworked?,"Currently, I am in my third semester of college studying computer science and I am swarmed constantly with work. Between my calculus 3 course, computer science 2, and physics, I am working eight hours a day on homework and often have no energy by the end of it. 

My grades are not horrible per se. two B's, an A and a C, but you can see why I would want more A's in my courses. I notice that while I do fine for normal assignments such as labs, I get lower grades on tests and quizzes.

At my community college, I was originally wanting to do law, then went to environmental science, and then fell in love with a political economy course. 
I chose economics because I like math and, well, was told if I like Political Science and math, I would do well in Economics. The problem is I realize I love calculus and hate statistics. I just failed an econometrics test. And I’m soooo bored in my economics courses. I thought after the intro courses it would get better but I’m still bored. And my grades are only on average C-B+. 
I loved my English/Social Science courses and got A’s but my advisors told me “you’re too smart for that do something more”. I’m not making this up, they all pushed for students to do like engineering or business degrees. 
Aaaaaaahhhh what do I do! I don’t want to graduate with a degree I don’t like but I feel like it’s too late. After this semester I only have 2 left until graduation. It’s technically been 4.5 years since I started this thing, should I just get it done? Who at the school do I even talk to?

Advice and opinions on leaving University late to go into a Trades college," (I originally posted this in r/Advice, but I got no help there, so here I am!)

&#x200B;

Hey all. I'm on mobile so sorry about formatting.

I'm in my 4th year of university, with about another 2 years left. I had a really bad year (mentally) last year so I decided to take things slow for the duration of my studies. Problem is, I've been wanting to leave university to go to a trades college for the past 2 years, and the longer I wait to decide, the worse I feel about it. After being coaxed by family into going to university I went into Humanities because I didn't know what I wanted to do. Even though I've learned a lot, I know that I'm not leaving university with the skills necessary to go straight into a specialized field, and it's honestly crushing. If I dropped out right now and took up a 2 year training program for a specialized field, I would pay half of a single year of university tuition, and be ready for employment right out of the gate.

When I first started wondering about why I'm in university and started looking for alternatives, my family was not happy. It didn't matter to them what I studied, as long as I studied at a university and not do trades. I'd understand if they were paying for it I guess, but I'm doing this all on my own and taking out huge loans for it. And that's another problem. I have 10's of thousands in loans for a program that I don't think I could get a job with. Hell, I don't even know where to begin looking for jobs with humanities degree that doesn't require an additional 3 to 4 years of study (masters or specialized training). And if I leave Uni to go to a trades college, NOTHING transfers over. Sure, I can write essays (both research and opinionated), and understand the complexities of Shakespeare... But essentially those last 4 years may as well have never happened (except now I have loads of debt).

My GPA is also absolutely atrocious. It's gone way downhill since I started wanting to leave, and with my mental health issues that popped up last year it's been exacerbated tremendously (less than 2.0). Only reason I haven't been kicked out of the program is because I still ""pass"" half of my classes each semester. School still gets their money anyway I guess.

I guess I'd just like to hear some stranger's point of view on this, someone who can look in and give their opinion without any ties to the situation. I pretty much have 2 weeks to decide since the semester drop date is coming up soon.

Thanks to anyone who's listened <3",3,1,8.113871060849892,college
How important are clubs on a resume?,"I think I've seen this asked before, but I'm just wondering how important clubs are on resumes. I'm currently a junior and have not joined a club. My freshman and sophomore year I worked 30+ hours a week and took 15-17 credits per semester so I really didn't feel like I had time to join a club and still have time for homework
 Also, most clubs meet at night and I didn't want to sacrifice hours at work to go to one. I just quit my job a month ago because my course load is heavy this semester and I saved my goal amount of money. I'm now wondering if joining a club will help my resume at all. I'm a marketing and economics major and I go to a fairly small school so there's not many clubs that pertain directly to my major. I could join a general business one, but it wouldn't benefit me much in terms of learning about econ/marketing, so I'd only want to look into it if it would help boost my resume. I'm in an economics honor society which isn't really a club but I could at least add that to my resume. I'm not sure how much employers care about GPA, but I currently have a 3.92 (only non A course were outside my major) so I'd at least have something to show for my lack of extracurriculars. Also I was a supervisor at the job I mentioned before and worked there for over 3 years. Just wanted some opinions on if a club seems like it would add much to my resume!

Now here’s my gut feeling. I tend to either go to the library a lot cuz I love it sometimes and I feel like I should give my roommate some alone time, but the downside to that is everyone on my floor is getting along.

How important are extracurriculars in college?

But exactly how important is being involved in extracurriculars in college? In high school, it was nearly a requirement to be in at least 3 extracurricular activities and have leadership positions - does it matter as much in college?

So is this normal for arts courses in universities? (Canada),"So long story short i am in a canadian university (UNB) and enrolled in arts first year.

Basically the list of courses state for eg 15 1st year courses available in a given subject. checking this year fall and winter timetable shows maybe only half of that offered. Last year offered courses were different as well.

So is this normal or is it a sign that my school's humanities programme is greatly underfunded lol XD

Need advice. I think my roommate is depressed and it is getting difficult on me.,"So i’m a freshman and my roommate and I are both introverts. The first 2-3 weeks were alright and we both got out and did events and went to class but then she seemed to just stop. Now she misses class fairly often, is absolutely always in the room, and rarely is with anyone besides the occasional time where her boyfriend (who she met here early on) comes over, but they’re pretty much always in our room.  She rarely even gets food on campus, she just gets it delivered like once a day. 

I often come back to the room to her napping so I have to be quiet and the room is dark. If i invite her out she’ll come but we are better roommates than best friends and because of my own mental health issues it’s really important I spend time with the friends i’ve made here and she just isn’t a part of that group. I’ve tried suggesting cool free things for her and her boyfriend to do on campus but they never do anything besides watching movies in her bed. They both have cars here and have maybe gone out like 2 or 3 times? She once expressed interest in the gaming center on campus so we went out together and walked through it but has never gone by herself. 

It’s getting really hard for me to never have alone time and always have to be in a dark quiet room. There’s literally no where I can be alone and i’m exhausted and desperate to be able to dance to music. I’m not really in a great mental state (using campus therapy/psych services rn don’t worry) to take her on because I feel like it would be a full time job and I would lose the friends i’ve made here. Should I talk to her mom the next time she comes? I don’t really feel like the boyfriend cares because he seems to encourage it (although he is pretty nice) so I don’t think talking to him would be good or my place. She doesn’t really have other friends on campus either. What should I do while still being considerate? As much as i’d love to just kick her out of the dorm every now and then that wouldn’t help the problem.",20,23,9.015560875664706,college
Leaving School after first semester - Want to apply elsewhere in the fall,"For personal, financial and creative reasons I have made plans to likely not attend school after my current semester (freshman year) finishes.

Allergies and Axe body spray,"I have an allergy to Axe (too much) and sneeze my head off.

During break I bee-line it to outside, it clears instantly.  Until guys from class come up to me, too close, drenched in Axe.

On top of this, my professor is a total jerk and I don't want to deal with him (have had to argue points back on 3/4 of the assignments so far).

I was thinking that if I dropped math I would be able to focus more on my portfolio and do some projects on my own that could boost my resume, but I'm also considering transferring and I don't know if it will look good if I don't take a math class this semester.

Testing out for credit,"I’ve messaged my professor about this but I’m an online student so this may take a while. 

My state has a requirement to take 4 semesters of foreign language. As an online student, I have very little choice when it comes to what language I can take. I’ve decided on Spanish since I’ve done 2 years in high school and I figured I wouldn’t need to study to keep up.

The problem is, I still have to do 9.5 hours of homework a week in VHL. It takes so much of my time. I know universities wanna make money on education so this might not be an option, but I’ve been studying Japanese since finishing high school and I am 100% sure I can test out of their 100 level classes(my husband took them, they’re ridiculously slow paced).

What’s getting me through loneliness now that I disabled social media,"Disabled social media due to always comparing my poop life to my old friends and how they’re having new friends and an actual life!

that helps with stopping myself with comparisons, but now I have to deal with my loneliness here. 

I’m in a Learning Community so everyone on my floor is supposed to get along. I know everyone’s names, they know mine, but all of them have cliques in the floor and I’m here knowing every single person, but not being able to join them in their fun, even when our community has events to do.

I’m def not joining a LC next year, but what’s getting me through hearing people having fun outside in the hallway and realizing I’m freaking lonely is that I compare college to high school now. In high school, yes I said hi to friends and talked and all that stuff, but when I got home, I didn’t go out unless it was for work.

Should I get an iPad?,"Hello fellow college students...simple question. Is an iPad worth the money? Specifically an iPad Air 3 for $450 ($350 cause I have a gift card) absolutely, 100% worth every penny? I have a 2015 MacBook Pro so I don't need it for laptop capability, but I figured it would be a good tool for note taking, and also annotating things like PDFs and Textbooks.

I know there are ""ways"" to get free textbooks online, or cheaper online books, but I absolutely can NOT use my laptop for reading textbooks. For me, I LOVE having hard copies to write in, highlight, annotate, and do practice problems (I'm engineering so I basically study by doing practice problems). I figured with an iPad I could download the textbooks on my laptop and send them to the iPad, where I can annotate things just as I do now. However, is this change worth the $350 (not to mention the price of a stylus and keyboard as well)?

I read that the older models of iPad didn't have any laminated display, which made writing much more difficult and sloppy, so I would want a newer model, at most a few years old. This is why the iPad Air 3 seems like a good option, because it has a lot of good features for WAY less than the new iPad Pro, and even less than last generation iPad Pro...

Those of you with iPads, was the transition from paper and pencil awkward? Should I wait until next semester with fresh classes to make the transition? Should I even make the transition, because I also have food to pay for and other living expenses that take priority? I can afford an iPad, but I basically worked like crazy over high school, saving money for college living expenses, and don't want to blow it on toys that seem like tools, if that makes sense.

EDIT: I also pay for all my textbooks now, so would an iPad actually SAVE me money? Does anyone download textbook PDFs to their iPad? Cheap? Free? Still just as expensive?",5,1,9.403408097886928,college
"Current marketing major, would do CS but done with all my buisness requirements, thinking about information systems?","Hi, my name is Drake and I'm currently in my 5th semester of college as a marketing major but thinking about changing majors. The marketing courses I'm taking this semester right now are Marketing Research in person and Marketing Management online and honestly, I feel like I'm taking the same class and a lot of it is common knowledge. For example this past Thursday in my marketing research class I sat through a powerpoint on how to make a survey. I end up just getting bored in my in-person class and for my online course I barely even read the textbook. I brought up about a year ago that I was thinking about switching to MIS and my marketing friends said that it's super hard. The info systems program at my university is actually called Business Analytics and Information Systems (BAIS), I guess it's called that because there's more of an emphasis on Analytics in the major and I'm pretty sure all the other public universities in my state are just IS. I love business which is why I originally majored in marketing but the marketing I would like to do is more analytical (Paid Per Click Advertising), but I also find the idea of using data to make more money interesting which is why I think Bussiness Analytics and Information Systems is more my fit. In the intro ISM course (code for BAIS classes), I liked it, missed an A by 0.3 percent, the professor doesn't round. So I have a somewhat idea of how the major works but the major isn't really big, I don't really know anyone in the major but most of my friends are in marketing or accounting. 

My plan for next semester is to take two BAIS courses that can go towards the minor and if it's not for me I'll just minor in BAIS and major in marketing but if it is for me I'll major in BAIS and minor in marketing. 

Anyone currently majoring in MIS, IS, or Business Analytics could tell me what the classes are like and if they enjoy it or not? Also, people in CS majors at this point in my college career is it really worth it to full-on switch to CS?

Also, people who major(ed) in Info Systems, what coding languages did you learn, it seems like it's mostly SQL and I think Python at my school. They've had java and C# classes but I don't think they are being offered next semester. 

Side Note: In business, you have to take every intro business course (Which is a lot) so most of my classes will already count towards the BAIS major which is why I don't think to go into CS is a wise economical choice. 

I want to learn some programming which is why I'm interested in the IS major, but I don't really care if I become a developer, I'm more interested in data jobs tbh.",6,7,9.409507634923965,college

How to not get what I call “lost in the sauce?”,"Idk yesterday it hit me when it was 1am, I’m drunk af, and I realized I forgot to turn in test corrections for an important exam, and then I kind of realized that I’m kind of going overboard with everything, and getting lost in the sauce. My social life has probably never been this concrete and even though I still think I’m goofy and awkward, I’ve somehow learned how to mesh better with people and as a result there has been a lot more smoking and drinking. 

I live at home too, so I think admittedly it’d be a couple magnitudes worse if I lived in the dorms. I had a 3.5gpa last year, and this year I’m finding it hard to keep up with hw, having motivation to study, and just do school things. All my life I was the academic person, and now I’m finding that social things seem to be much more rewarding, and maybe there’s a subconscious motivational factor. 

Idk I emailed the teacher like at 3am, once I got home I turned it in, bc I already had them done, but I just needed to take a picture and submit them. I really feel so stupid for this one, but I’m taking this as a small wake up call before things get worse.

"So far, not so good. I need some advice.","I am a freshman in college attending a selective tech school that is heavy on workload... And it's been weighing down on me. Back in HS I was an AP student, was in top 10 in my class, had a 4.0 GPA, but it was all because I studied. My grades never came naturally to me. Now that I'm in college, I'm taking more courses at once that all moves very quickly, and honestly I'm not sure how to handle this. I had my first wave of exams and I did bad on 2/3 (have yet to take the 3rd, wish me luck), despite the fact that I studied for hours for a WEEK before the exam arrived. I don't understand what's wrong with me if I study so much yet manage to do so badly. This is especially worrisome because it was in calc, and I'm majoring in physics. I know I understand these topics, but it does not show in my grades. I get even more stressed seeing the people around me not work as hard and get such good grades so easily. I'm thinking I overestimated my abilities because of how I did in HS. 

I also am having trouble making friends. Luckily my bf happens to go to the same school as me, but despite my efforts in joining clubs/ organizations and initiating conversations, nothing has stuck even if I felt a connection with the person. Yet again, my efforts only yield disappointment.

I'm posting this because I don't know what else I can do. I'm wearing myself thin with how much work I do, and I just can't help but cry seeing the results. Seeing all the cliques forming around me makes me feel more lonely than ever. I have a few friends back at home I talk to, but it's different when they are moving on with their lives and I'm stuck in this loop. I really don't want to feel this awful anymore, but I simply don't know where to start.

"Advice About A Classmate? (Really long, please read)","Okay. So I want to preface this by saying I don’t think this classmate is a bad guy-he’s sweet. 

HOWEVER. I’m so tired of him. This is the second class I’ve had with him. I usually get to class ten minutes early, as I go to college and work, I enjoy using that time to get any work I can started, text friends, or read. This guy, even when I’m obviously busy, seeks me out and starts talking to me every time. 
I try to participate to be friendly-he talks over me and only ever talks about himself, how he ‘never has to pay bills or rent’ and about all his travels and not needing to have a job so he can travel all he wants. He constantly talks to me and never seems to want to stop to ask anything about me unless it’s somehow a way to talk more about himself (asked me if I’ve been placed in a school yet, then cuts me off after a one word answer to brag about his placement and how much people like him).
Both classes are/were about three hours. So we often had time to do a lesson plan assignment (education classes) to make sure we were doing it right. He never brought a laptop, so he wouldn’t do the assignment in class and just try to talk to me instead. Interrupting my work. 
Classmates sometimes jump in if we’re working together or have to pair up.  But I keep randomly getting paired with him (professor has us count off, line up by height or hair length then group off). He constantly needs to be directed to do the work instead of talking or doing it incorrectly and...

I know it’s mean of me, but it’s gotten to the point where I’m not looking forward to this class anymore. I love the material and my other classmates but it feels like this guy is inescapable. I don’t want to be mean to him and the class is only 13 people in total, including myself, and it doesn’t end till December. He’s told me before about having ‘accommodations’ in school when he was young, but only ever talked about speech problems, never anything like ADD or ASD. So I don’t know if maybe he’s on the spectrum and just doesn’t realize it’s not appropriate? 

I don’t know how to approach this. Advice would be helpful.",7,12,9.557864116405447,college
Roommate Advice: Odor,"I've been having an issue with my roomate, and was wondering if y'all had any advice.

I'm a first year in college and have been living with my roommate for around 1 month. The first day he moved in, I noticed his smell. It's hard to describe, but it is musty and unpleasant.

I have recently had friends over who have said that the smell is almost unbearable to be in my room for more than a minute or two. The smell is very localized to him. When he is not in the room, I can spray some febreeze and air it out. However, I'm worried that with winter coming I won't be able to leave the windows open for an extended period of time.

I currently have been spraying febreeze and using an essential oil diffuser to make the room smell better, but it isn't working nearly enough and I don't feel comfortable spraying it when he is in the room.

I have spoken to my RA about the issue and ideally would like to find a solution that doesn't involve a room change.

I was wondering if any of you had ideas or solutions for more serious odor problems. I'm pretty desperate to try anything.",12,38,9.572378005294336,college

Just shattered my fucking dorm window.,"AC breaks. Hot as balls. But it’s cold outside. Idea! Open window. Damn! It’s screwed shut. Wait! I have a screwdriver! Shit! It’s tamperproof torx! Wait, I have a small flathead! I can open it! I open it. The whole window even lays down flat. Kind of like when you’re at a hotel and they open just a bit, but all the way instead since I removed all the safety screws. It’s cool. Run a fan. Really nice! But there’s no screen. Well, I’m going to bed so I’ll put the window up and just leave it cracked. Ha! If that isn’t the irony. I leave to go the bathroom and come back. The door slams. The vibration moves the window. The window pivots on its bottom edge, swings open like a wide ass door, and smashes. Shards of glass everywhere. On the floor. In the AC unit. On the fridge. On my bed. In my backpack. Fast forward to me picking up enough shards of glass to fill up two garbage bags and then some, gashing my pinky, clotting and bandaging up (have three red tissues now), and vaccuuming up the rest of the shards. The window still has a lot of broken glass in it. I take the window out and set it down. Well, the window is open now huh? Sure as hell don’t want them to come fix it and it to be hot. So fuck it. I’ll just go to bed and remain cool. To be honest when it smashed, the first thing I thought of wasn’t the clean up, or the damage, or the noise that definitely woke my whole floor up, but the cost. Now I have to pay for it... god damn it. And it’s all my fault. I would say live and learn, but then I’d still be hot, so I’m gonna put a pin in this one.",10,27,9.806614116405447,college
Struggling with a transfer,"Hey guys, I'm an architecture student and technically a junior (transferred in to a 4 year from a 2 year Associates degree). I am having so many problems. I feel like I crashed and burned the first day of school, and all my professors and advisors are doing is throwing fuel on the fire.

This school uses a completely different set of software that I'm used to. I've been trying to learn on the fly for the two major ones but really only made headway in one so far. And their process of doing things is so chaotic and I guess admittedly less ""hand-holdy"" than my 2 year, but I feel like I don't have enough info for the project.

Over half of my class is confused about our overall grade. We asked the teacher about it but he is not giving us a direct answer. Not sure what to do.,"For a brief background, I am currently enrolled in a math class where we meet in person twice a week but we have online assignments. All of these assignments say they are due December 11th but I try to keep on track with what we are learning in class with the assignments for the tests we take.

My class is set up so we can see our grades online and my grade says it's 88%. Well, here is the confusion. On the tests we get back our teacher puts our test score and the number of points totals we could have possibly earned in class so far and the number of points we have earned. It said I have D- in the class. I quickly looked at my online grade to see if it was altered but nope, still says I have a B+. I even refreshed it a few times. This happened on Wednesday and my grade still says it is a B+.

I asked a few classmates if they had a similar problem as well and they did. A lot of people in my class thought they were passing based on the grade our grade book is giving us but our teacher is telling them they're not, they're borderline failing, or their grade is lower than they thought it was. A few students asked him about it (literally asked the same question five times in a row) and he was super vague and he did not really give anyone a true answer about the situation. It just left students even more confused.

I would also like to note there are no assignments that have been graded and have not been put in the system by my teacher. I even have a few low scored assignments (two for being absent and two for not understanding the material that well) but those are already put into the grading system but even with those low scores my grade still says B+.

I need help picking a major!,"Hi Guys. I know I'm posting a bit late at night but I'm really hoping someone could help me and give me some insights into what would be a good fit into pursuing. I've changed my major twice now and I'm currently UnDecided. I've been pouring over my college's website and I still am not 100% convinced on a single point.

Fast facts about me that I hope will help:

* I have worked a lot of years in retail in customer service. I am good at it but I hate it. Never want to go back. I don't want to ever work with customers. I don't ever want to work sales!
* I originally majored in sociology. I really enjoyed the subject but I was much younger and dumber and unprepared for college. I also was not sure I wanted to purely research all day. I dropped out.
* Went back to college for Graphic Design. Kind of fun but very mundane, tedious work intensely staring at a computer all day. Manipulating pixels was not rewarding or satisfying, job prospects bad with low pay, high cost of career upkeep. So I left this major and am undecided now. However, I enjoyed the research, branding, user experience, and advertising aspect of it (but we didn't get too into it so I wouldn't say these were my ""passions"" or anything). I can navigate Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign though I don't particularly enjoy them. Please DO NOT tell me to go back to this major, I really overall did not like it.
* I am atrociously bad at math. Like I am worried about even getting a good enough score in placement testing to get into Business Math, which is the lowest credit math course available.
* Therefore I'm pretty bad at science when getting into formulas.
* I think some of my strengths are that I am not too shabby with writing/written communication, I am a good big idea person, and I am decent at coming up with good ideas/concepts for different types of projects/subjects.
* I hope my future job will be in an office with no physical labor needed and no driving around needed, I'd like to work with a team of people but working on my own is fine too.
* I am obviously concerned with making money but to be honest, what is more important to me is somewhat enjoying my job and having nice work conditions, even if that means I don't make too much money (though money is always nice and welcome! lol!). I just want a nice little job with a nice little career going for me.
* I don't want to spend all day doing maths or doing programming (I know this is so popular but I've tried learning a variety of languages and I am simply both not good at it AND I really don't like it!).
* I am a bit introverted and reserved but I am capable of communication with others and even giving presentations and handling public constructive criticism (thank you to graphic design for that).
* edit to add I have no interest in the medical field, in teaching, or working with kids.

I would so greatly appreciate any and all suggestions and advice.",14,1,10.0506534682573,college
Are dependency overrides only for dire situations?,"I want to be able to pay for college, but it pisses me off to no end that my parents income is going to be considered.

Not sure what direction to take. Need some advice.,"I went to college right out of school. It went... ok. Wasn’t great or bad. I struggled with a few things (in school and in my personal life) so it became an on/off thing. Then I think I stoped at the end of 2017. I was really bad at planning things and meeting with counselors so I didn’t see the end in sight. 


Now I really want to go back and accomplish something but I’m not sure if going back to computer science is what I want. I’ve been looking into other similar subjects that interest me and possibly trade schools. I would hate to have to start from scratch but maybe somebody could suggest an option that offers some middle ground for me. 


If anyone have any suggestions or advice I’d really appreciate it. Thank you.",1,1,10.102690505294335,college
Letter of Rec- Professor Left the University?,"I need a letter of recommendation for an on-campus program I'm applying to. I had a professor in mind who I wanted to ask, but he left after this past semester and now teaches at a different school. The other professor I would typically ask can't do it because she's the director of the program I'm applying to. The one who left is really the only other one who I got to know pretty well last year (I'm a sophomore so I haven't had a ton of different professors).

Basically, I'm wondering if  it would be acceptable for me to ask the professor who left to write the letter. I'm not sure if the university would care that I chose a professor who now teaches at a different school. He taught at my university and its law school for several years, and I know he was regarded in pretty high esteem while he was here, but would it be better for me to ask someone who currently teaches here anyway?",5,2,10.12119744973878,college
I feel like crying... all the time,"Edit : I’ve already read the “how to make friends guide here”

I’m about 2 months into my first year of college. Going into college I was so hopeful in making some friends, since I’d lost all of my mine in junior year of high school.

Instead, I have 1 person who I talk to maybe once a week outside of classes.

I feel like crying all the time because I see people having fun and laughing with their friends and I dont have any.

I dont know how, where, or when to approach people. And it’s weird bc with the consensus being that you need to approach people to make friends, I would have thought that at least one person would have approached me by now. But I literally havent been approached by one person. No one - not even during orientation - has walked up to me to introduce themselves, strike up a conversation, or do anything.

I hate it. I came into college knowing no one, and now I’m scared that it will stay this way.

I would approach the guys who are in my classes, but we dont have much in common. I’m a gay dude who’s majoring in engineering, and lots of people in classes talk about vaping, sports, etc... but I’m not into any of that.

I’m usually less nervous when talking to girls but there’s deadass barely any girls in my engineering classes.

But my family literally disowned me recently, and all I do is think about that. It’s my birthday tomorrow and have nothing to distract me from that, no one to talk to, and no one to even spend my birthday with.

I’m a really open person tbh. I’m literally down to try anything and give everything at least 1 shot

TLDR : I’m sad as shit bc I have no friends and dont know how, where, or when to approach people since it’s already 2 months in and people have their friend groups.",16,41,10.123813190479522,college

So sketchball dude is still in our apartment. It’s been two weeks.

Dealing with a long commute?,"Fellow commuter students: how do you deal with long, frustrating commutes?

On a good day, my commute is only about 20 minutes, which isn’t bad – although it is a 10 minute walk to class, so I usually try to leave 40 minutes before class so I’m not rushing. 

However, there have been a few days with construction or rain. It was lightly raining the other morning (which, of course, means no one knows how to fucking drive) and it took me over 35 minutes to just drive there. Today, it took me 45 minutes to get home because of construction. 

And I live in the Midwest, where we’re expecting a really really nasty winter. I can’t even imagine how long it’s going to take to get to class when the roads are icy and we start getting snow. My high school was about 10 minutes away, and I remember days where it’d almost take an hour to get there because the roads were so bad (... those were really the days we should’ve had snow days).

I took a break and feel like I made a mistake,"I took a break from school this term. Long story, basically was my freshman year last year (but had been taking classes all through high school) and I didn’t have a good time. I failed my first round of midterms and then worked my ass off, finishing all of those classes with A’s and just continued the year like that, constantly working on keeping my grades at an A. But if I even slipped on any grade I had a full blown panic attack. I let it upset me for hours. I have a mental breakdown if there’s a possibility I might get less than an A in a class (that includes A-). It got to the point where if I had gotten 11/12 on a chemistry quiz I would cry. At some point towards the end of the year I was crying everyday, begging my parents to bring me home early because I wanted to die. They didn’t but I went home at the end of that term.

Over the summer I was barely preparing to go back and as time got closer I started not sleeping, crying all the time, and feeling this hole in my gut every time I thought about buying a plane ticket back. My parents told me it was up to me, and they were proud and will support me with anything I do which helped. I decided to stay home and take a break. But now that I’m doing that I feel like I’m so behind, that I failed and shouldn’t have done that. 

I definitely feel like I’m weak and just let my heart decide instead. I should’ve sucked it up and gone back. My parents disagree, as they think I have an extreme anxiety/perfectionist problem when it comes to school.

Should I confess to some mild cheating that I did several years ago?,"It's my last semester as an English Major. My first semester, I took a Greek class. (I hadn't chosen a major yet.) I was doing well in the class until the final exam. It was a take-home, closed-book test (which doesn't seem fair, because you know some of the other students will cheat). We were supposed to translate and parse a document from Greek to English without using the glossary at the back of the book. Some of the words though were completely unfamiliar and felt kind of unfair, and so I peeked in the glossary for some of them but also was honest for some other words I couldn't decipher.

I ended up getting a B+ in the class. I'm guessing I might have gotten around a C in the class if I'd been completely honest on the final. To this day, that's the most dishonest thing I've ever done in school, and it haunts me like twice a year when I think back to it.

For 3 hours he lectures about what he feels about the current politics, as well as abstinence.

I don’t think any professor should lecture about their political thoughts. I have learned absolutely nothing in this class. I would learn more about ethics by reading the bathroom stall graffiti.

Should I transfer? Sorta on edge and thinking about it gives me some anxiety...,"So, I feel i'm in a great college. I don't have to do exams, there are no tests or quizzes, and seems like an all around great college and it's a 4 year university. Well, I've been thinking about transferring to another college after the first year at this one is finished and I'll transfer with like a 3.86 gpa. 

The current one I'm going to is a private university, and I want to transfer to an in state university come like Februaryish. But normal colleges operate on semesters and terms, mine you get a break on rotation so 11 days after 2 A courses and 4 days after B courses... 

One of the reasons I'm considering this is that I'll be able to live in a dorm, in an urban environment, not out in the back sticks like I am currently... I'd be in walking distances of jobs because I have epilepsy and can't drive & my state is stupid and wont give me disability or SSI so i'm out of luck there.... 

It gives me a bit of anxiety just to type this bc I don't want to mess something up, because my current whole tuition of this university is nearly 70k, but an instate university is only 10.8k.... so there are a lot of benefits, but mental anxiety sucks... advice?",2,2,10.953546998338016,college

Partying,"Hi, apologies for formatting, on mobile.

I am not entirely opposed to going, and I know that they all want to go, so I'm kind of reevaluating my opinions on partying and drinking at my age. Do you think I should try and go to this party (that everyone I know who has gone in the past has said was absolutely amazing) even though I've never partied or drank before, or do I ask my friends to hang out with me instead and miss the biggest party of the year?

I haven’t been to a single party the entire year (started August 23rd) and it’s making me really feel like I’m missing out on a chance to really make memories and have a good time. I never really went to that many parties in highschool because I was kinda reserved and wasn’t in that kind of crowd (my highschool was supper clicky). I thought that in college I would start branching out and having more fun but the lack of a social scene and the amount of work that I need to get done constantly is a little soul crushing. My friends who went to other schools are constantly talking to me about drinking and fucking around and how their lives have changed for the better since they moved, and while I don’t feel like my life has gotten any worse I really don’t feel like it’s gotten any better. I get jealous of my friends who seem like their having the times of their lives in school.

I feel like I can’t write papers anymore.,"Hi,

I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing something similar or knows what’s going on.

I’m a senior in college and I’m a humanities major, so I’ve been writing papers the whole time I’ve been here. It got to the point of familiarity that even the papers I wrote really quickly ended up good. 

I got back to college after the summer, and now I feel like I’ve lost it. I’m having so much trouble writing and planning my papers. I’m doubting everything I write, I feel like everything is bad, and I’m absolutely unable to write anything. I stare at blank screens for a long time because I feel like I don’t know how to do it anymore.

I’m very overloaded with work, I’m writing two theses by the end of this academic year, and I’m just exhausted. I don’t know if this has anything to do with it.

I’m getting frustrated because this stuff shouldn’t be taking me this long (I’m supposed to be writing a 2-3 page paper rn and it’s not coming to me). Am I burned out? Is this stress? Do I just need to get back into the swing of things? Has anyone else experienced the same thing?

Tips on how to manage workload?,"Freshman Chemical Engineering student here looking for any and all help he can get. 

So according to people I’ve talked to, I’m in one of the hardest majors at my university, and I’m in the honors college so that puts me at taking AP Calculus and AP Comp 2, upon Chemistry which is a difficult course on its own.

I’m barely passing Chemistry and Calculus. I’ve failed a test in each of them and I have a Calculus test Friday that I’m worried about. My life has been reduced to staying up until 1 AM every morning the past two weeks because if I’m not doing homework for a class, I’m making a desperate attempt to study. I have weekly papers I have to write for my bullshit required music class, essays and analysis papers for Comp 2. I always did quite well in high school so I didn’t expect to be struggling so bad. 

I’m constantly stressed out because there’s always something due, there’s always an exam, and I never have time to enjoy life anymore. The past week has been the single worst of my life and I don’t know what to do about it. 

My roommate, a friend of mine I knew before college, has resorted to playful mocking me with my other friends because they’re always calling and talking to each other and playing video games online with each other but every time the ask me to play with them I always have to tell them no. I haven’t even played video games in weeks, and it’s been over a month since I’ve hung out with friends other than my roommate.

How does one fund college when you're absolutely clueless and also pretty much have nothing?,"For context, I'm 18 years old, renting a room in a house for about $500 a month, paying for it by a fast food job. I left home because ~~abusive parents~~.
I was never very ambitious as a high schooler, so I'm completely clueless about applying to colleges and funding it for that matter. My mother had forced me to file fafsa back in 2018, but as I never applied to any of the schools she wished me to, I don't even know if I could make anew fafsa again for myself.
Along with that, I don't want to go bankrupt with the risk of loans, especially with what the little I have is a room for $500 and a fast food job that pays 9/hour.
edit: for added context, I am female (regarding the comment on trade work). I also pretty much don't talk to my parents at all, because when I say abusive, I really do mean abusive (without delving into too many details). What I do wish to become is a baker, and to my knowledge that's more of a trade.
The main reason I ask this question is because I know you can go to community college (or a university that does have it) for culinary/pastry arts, and because lately I've been feeling pressure from my friends and acquaintances to try to put in the effort to attend some sort of higher education.

I study at home and watch YouTube videos and commit time every night to learning it but I just don’t understand it. I can’t stop everything to only focus on math, I have work and other classes to worry about as well.

should i take off the rest of the semester for medical leave?,"I'm in my second year at college and have been struggling with medical and psychological disabilities to the point of withdrawing until next semester. I have registered medical disabilities (POTS and EDS) as well as severe anxiety and depression. I recently got an entirely new medication plan, as I suffered a nervous breakdown last week, and have been struggling to find adequate care on campus for treating my deteriorating physical and mental state. I have had these medical disabilities for around 8 years now and my mental health is at an all time low, which is making it nearly impossible for me to keep up with schoolwork or even get out of bed for class in general due to either physical or mental blocks. I have recently been struggling with increased panic attacks, social anxiety and severe depression that makes me pretty much unable to go anywhere besides home and class. I am already set to graduate a year early, but I wonder if I should just power through the rest of the semester, as I feel withdrawing would make me feel even more disconnected from people, as well as making my feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth worse. Similarly, I feel like it would make me super anxious taking the semester off knowing that other people probably struggle with similar things and still pull it off. Any advice or suggestions?

UPDATE: according to my university's policy, if i move out for medical leave they'll give my room in my apartment to someone else and i wont be able to move back in. i wouldnt be able to handle the stress of living somewhere else/with people new because of my already crippling social anxiety so now i really dont know what to do.",5,2,11.22387107241209,college

5th year in college and think I chose the wrong major (engineering),"All my life I’ve had a passion for animals, and when I got out of high school I wanted to go into a career where I could study wildlife and the environment.  I chose to major in environmental science because I thought that this major would allow me to do that. I attended community college as an environmental science major, but after a year I decided I should switch to environmental engineering. I switched because I’m very good at math and have had a couple teachers that urged me to go into a more mathematical field. I also heard that job prospects and salaries are better with the engineering major, and both my siblings majored in engineering, so I figured if they can do it, so can I. 

So I spent the rest of community college (4 years total) taking prerequisites for environmental engineering, and just this year I transferred to UC Irvine. At UCI I am taking upper division mechanics and physics classes, and I hate it. Physics is my worst subject and I have no passion for creating structures or building anything. When I look at the courses I have to take over the next 2 years to graduate, I feel intimidated and unexcited because everything looks very difficult, and almost nothing looks interesting to me. If my future job is going to be about building things, then I’m not sure I will be very happy in my career.

What I’m studying now (upper division physics/mechanics) is so far off from what I originally wanted to study (wildlife). I’m not sure that environmental science would even allow me to study what I want, and in hindsight I think I probably should have chosen to major in wildlife biology or zoology. I feel dumb because I don’t think I put enough thought into my choice of major. However, I’m 22 now and more than 4 years into college, and worried it may be too late to change majors. I’m also not sure how easy it would be to get a job as a wildlife biology major, but I know that job prospects are good for engineers. Anyways I’m not sure what to do. Any advice?

TLDR: I wanted to study wildlife, but ended up majoring in environmental engineering. I hate my classes and don’t feel a passion for engineering, but I’m not sure if it’s too late to change majors. Looking for advice.",2,3,11.324588665004681,college

Some people just don't adjust well to uni and ive heard stories of people developing chronic illness/mild inconveniences due to the stress. Others adjust fine and live life as normal.

I know my mom's friend's son developed a terrible skin rash from stress in first year of civil engineering and doctors couldn't really pinpoint it to anything other than stress.

In my experience I developed digestive problems where I couldn't eat much food before beginning to feel like vomiting... doctors have done testing and couldnt find anything wrong with my stomach and ive come to a conclusion its stress related.

For reference, im taking 8 courses this semester (i go to a technological institute in Canada) and commute 2 hours total every day to get to school. So it's probably safe to say I'm rather tired.

I've heard stories that people grow out of their stress after graduation too. Bringing up my mom's friend's son again, his rash disappeared once he moved into third year and stabilized himself a bit.

What should I do?," I am currently enrolled in my freshman year of college, and I was placed into a temporary triple. For reasons I won't go too much into detail for (coming home late drunk (underage),loud, douchebags (objectifying women, abusing various drugs(adderall, oxy, antidepressants), as well as staying up very late with the tv on), I do not get along with my roommates, and they make choices I don't agree with. I have tried talking to them about being more quiet, and keeping the alcohol elsewhere, to no avail. I want to move out so badly, but the building I am in has very good rooms and is probably the best place to live on-campus.

How do you deal with bad group partners?,"I've had two group projects in two different classes so far, and in both, I'm the only one that deos any work or even meets when/where we've discussed. Right now, I have a project due tomorrow for a 9:25am class. My partner and I had to create two scenarios with effective/non-effective communication. I wrote nearly all the script and all the analysis. It's not from me being a control-freak but because my partner gave absolutely no feedback and never actually contributed ideas. Also, he left the class for 15 minutes to go to the bathroom and left me to do the work. We were supposed to present last Friday, but my professor had an emergency and left us to film our presentation and then email it. My parter wasn't in class, so of course we couldn't film that day. I saw him later and talked about it and he said he'd be away all weekend. Then, he wasn't in class Monday. I didn't see him Tuesday, but discussed it with him Wednesday, saying to meet around 12:30 for today, and he agreed. I saw him earlier today and we both confirmed our meeting time and place. 12:30 comes around and of course I showed up, but he didn't. I waited for 20 minutes, sent him an email (dont have his number), and left. Now I don't know what to do since he needs to be in the video.

I'm worried about my chances of getting into grad school because of my GPA,"THIS FIRST PARAGRAPH IS ALL BACKGROUND ON MY EXPERIENCE IN COLLEGE SO FAR, THE SECOND IS WHERE I ASK/NEED ADVICE. 

My college career has been less than optimal. I attend UT Austin, and during my time here I've learned so much about myself and life, but unfortunately it was at the cost of my GPA. Freshman and sophomore year I struggled immensely with depression and had no motivation to do well in school. I was in Biochemistry and I was so unhappy but I didn't get the help I needed because I thought I could get through it alone (really stupid mistake but I learned my lesson). I was so embarrassed about it and it hid it for so long from my friends and family, and I let effect my academics. Junior year was when everything came crashing down. I was academically dismissed after failing out in the fall semester, and this was my wake up call. Its like the trauma and horror of failing out woke me up finally. I didn't attend school the spring semester and I worked and did a lot of soul searching. The semester off was one of the most eye opening and perspective changing experiences in my life. It gave me so much self growth and helped me finally realize how much I really wanted to graduate. So now I'm back in school, things haven't been 4.0 perfect but I've been doing SOOOO much better. I never miss class, I get my hw done, and studying for tests has been where I need to put in more work, but I've been on my grind.  

Now here's where I'm worried. My GPA is currently trashed, I think last time I looked I saw that I'm at a 1.9 gpa. yeah.... I've finally accepted where I'm at but now I need to figure out whats best for my chances of getting into Grad school. I am most likely going to be here at UT for 2 more years (this year and next year) so ill graduate may of 2021. I understand that the first thing I need to do is get the best grades possible, but is that even enough? Most grad schools I've looked at want to see you at a 3.0 gpa and to have a good GRE score, I'm sure I can get the GRE score where I need it to be, but I'm worried that even if I work my ass off and get 3.5 + for the next 4 semesters I may not make it, or I may be right under where I need to be. Would grad schools consider my situation I've been through, and if so will they also be able to see the huge change in my academic progress? I'm sure that I could explain in any interview why my grades were so low but if any of ya'll have any advice for me and my situation that would be wonderful, thanks ya'll! 

&#x200B;

tl;dr 

I failed my first 3 years of college because of depression, after a semester off I'm back and doing so much better. I want to go to grad school but I'm afraid my gpa will be my issue (currently at a 1.9 and I have 2 years left). If I don't make it to a 3.0 but show a lot of good progress will they take into my situation into consideration? Will they be able to see the difference in my scores post depression and understand my situation?",4,1,11.483489127967644,college

I talked with the supervisor on Monday. We started with a casual conversation on how our summer and new quarter was before getting into business.

She was really happy that I actually responded to her email because most former tutors ghosted her and tutoring center after being fired. She is well aware of my tutoring skills and she mentioned again that she removed me because of the attitude I brought to the tutoring center. I told her that I was going through more than her observations that led to my removal and that I have used this summer to understand myself more.

She asked me whether if I have any troubles in fitting in with my colleagues after being fired and she said that she will get involved if things get serious regarding my sudden disappearance. She offered me a backstory to explain my disappearance. I told her that I haven't mentioned anyone regarding my removal but people guessed it as I met some of my colleagues during summer classes and beginning of fall quarter. I told her that if anyone asked me, I don't mind telling them what happened in a professional and mature manner because denying it can be more cringe. And people that actually know me will ask for my disappearance.

She asked me for my availabilities and invited me for the introductory tutors meet-and-greet! I got the job!

Do I have a good reason to transfer?,"I'm a freshman at a private college in OH and to be honest, I'm not happy here at all. My classes are decent (nothing to brag about) and the campus is okay, but there's nothing about my classes that keeps me actively engaged (except for like one class). The students here are alright, but I don't click well with them enough to make friends at all. Even when I joined clubs and stuff, I didn't feel like I am a part of the club and stuff, like it would've been the same even if I wasn't there. In fact, everyone on my floor seemed to have found their little cliques and kind of sticks to it, not to mention they're kind of annoying (the kids here scream and fool around until like 2 in the morning. UPDATE: the girls on my floor have proven to be the absolute worst. Some girls would invite her friends up to the floor and talk loudly past quiet hours, a period where it should be quiet in the halls. This in itself is an university violation, not to mention rude.) They all make me miss having my own room in peace and my friends I left behind to go out of state, which I now regret. On top of all that is the financial burden. I knew coming to the school that I would need to pay out of pocket, but the idea didn't really sink in until I had to call my Mother and ask for the check. As of the past month here, I’ve been nothing but moody, miserable, tired, and most recently, as if an hour ago, irritated and robbed of my sleep.

So, long story short: the school I'm in isn't making me happy and I'm not enjoying my time here, so much so that I’ve essentially stopped eating (Im now only eating one meal a day, two if I have the energy) and I feel my mental health starting to decline.

I Graduate In May 2020 and I'm Worried About Finding A Job.,"First off, I'm freaking out as I have about 6 months of school and have to figure what to do with my life after graduation. I'm working with some career counselors at my school, yet I'm still worried.

Second, I feel like I'm getting remorseful over my decision on what my major is. I ended up doing Political Science (called Law and Politics at my school) and I feel like I made a terrible decision. I was so undecided with what I wanted to do with my life I ended getting into this major. At first I thought I was going to be an engineer but then said fuck that after I was sucking big time my first semester at my university (I did dual-enrollment prior at a small college then transfered). I ended up doing Political Science because I have an interest in politics and I've done really well since I've managed to get a 4.0 in all of my core classes for my major so I stuck with it. 

Now I'm freaking out because I'm looking at what's available for jobs and it ain't much. I've been considering graduate school, but I really need a year off first before I can even have the motivation to continue. And even the jobs that sound interesting are ones I have no clue what I would be doing on a day to day basis. Like how will I know what needs to be done. I know a lot of jobs offer training yet I'm still unsure what to do.

I'm at a point where I'm wishing two things. One I wish I knew I was interested in teaching sooner. I could work to get my Ph.D but that is extremely difficult, but then I could become a professor which I would prefer if I was teaching. I get passionate about teaching after having been a tutor and I just love it. My other interest though lies in Criminal Justice and the possibilty of being an investigator. But I don't know.

So now I either have to see what I can do with my major or do the awful thing and go immediately back to school for a new degree and I know that won't happen. It would most likely be three semesters to get the Criminal Justice requirements done at my current school. I have the rest done already.

What I'm good at is getting stuff done on time. I'm organized and can analyze stuff quickly and provide feedback yet I don't know what job would even include that in my field. I really just need to find a nice entry-level job preferably in an office being an assistant or something, but I just don't know what to do or where to go at this point.",4,3,11.95759792426394,college

I'm not trying to look down on those majors, but I'm the 1st person in my family to go to college, yet everyone keeps telling me not to be a teacher or don't study art because I won't be able to find a job or earn enough money, and I really don't know what to think or who to talk to on this matter. so what are your guys opinions on what I should do?",5,3,11.963408109449126,college
Sexual assuat and rape victims,Hey so I've been sexually abused and assulted since I was about 14. Last week I decided to draw my pain on memory mall with a huge chalk drawing that was literally gone by the next day. In the past week I've met so many women who've gone through similar instances but never talked about it or told anyone. I want to make a podcast telling this stuff. We have this idea of a perfect victim a prudish girl who gets brutally raped. But what about the girl who consented to oral but never consented to anal isnt that rape too. What about the 5 year olds that were too young to know they were being taken advantage of. I don't wanna focus on the incident im focusing on the after math. I wanna focus on how you feel now what you've accomplished in life. I don't wanna make a podcast about victims being defined by their trauma. I want to make a podcast about victims their trauma and who they are and how it affects them. I don't care how young you were or if your still friends with the person who hurt you. I don't care if it took you 5 years to realize your boyfriend raped you. I want all the stories anonymously of course but I just wanna redefine what a victim is and what they look like. I want to highlight that not everyone reports and it's ok to be silent. I know I'm asking a lot but I really wanna make this PM me privately. I can also disort your voice. You can send me a message with your story you don't have to tell it. Most importantly you can back out any time. If you decide you dont want it up ill take it down asap. I just wanna share these stories and like kinda show the wide spectrum of victims.,0,0,11.966718294634312,college

How to fix neck and back pain while studying?,"I’m a sophomore in college but this is the first time in school that I’m having pretty sore pains from studying. I try to have a good and straight posture when sitting and walking, and even attempted to fix my sleeping position, but my neck hurts every single day and my back hurts especially when I’m studying for a long period of time. I’m pretty sure this pain is from studying because I didn’t have it in the summer time (unless I just slept really weirdly that night). 

I really want to fix this problem because once the pain starts, I lose motivation to study. My neck pain ends up lasting all day and distracting me during class too (it’s not severe, just really annoying, like I have to constantly stretch my neck).

Currently struggling with one of my courses and I do NOT know what to do. Need advice. Just had a mental breakdown a few moments ago due to the stress,"I just don't know what to do, I tried everything. Study groups, extra help and yet I'm still struggling through college. I've paid a lot of money to get here, the reason why I'm here is to make my family proud and myself but I feel like that the world is just collapsing upon me. I keep failing quizzes, midterms are 2 weeks away. I don't get some of the content. Combine that with other courses it's just tearing me apart.

If you watched Spider-Man 2 or at least seen it once you would know exactly what I'm going through, it's like I'm climbing these walls, and yet whenever I try climbing them I keep falling. Picture Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, he's in university. He is struggling majorly and not just his classes, his aunt is having a hard time with the mortgage, he lost his job, he lost his best friend, he lost his love to another guy, he can't maintain his own life and all of that just crushes him. I just had a mental breakdown where I was watching the news and then a college ad aired where someone got accepted into college and her parents applaud her on how proud they are etc. Then I had this 'mental' conversation with my parents like when Peter was talking to Uncle Ben in his head in SM2. I pictured my family applauding me for getting accepted and to take their hand but I just turn it down saying ""No, I can't. Can't you see? I'm not able to sustain myself.""  Then I just collapsed and had my very first mental breakdown. I know I keep referencing this film but that masterpiece is a perfect rendition of what I'm going through right now. Like I said before, no matter how many times I try to climb the wall of success, no matter how many times I try to climb that wall I just keep falling down to the bottom.

I've just failed my driving test today and I started thinking about my college life and my failed attempt at the test and I just lost it,  I feel like Peter Parker from Spider-Man 2. I know I mentioned this so many times but it's true. I know I myself can't climb these walls alone so I'm asking for desperate help. What do you suggest I do? I'm running out of options and every time I see my failed grades I just think about my family and how much I let them down, the sacrifices they made for me all gone to waste.

I bombed a bio exam and now I feel like a dumbass,"So I'm a sophomore STEM major. Last year I had a pretty heavy course load, alongside extracirriculars in sports and music. I became stressed to the point of neglecting my health, and ended up having a mental breakdown on my way up for the second year. I decided that I needed a less hectic semester to focus on wellbeing and creating healthy habits in college, so I dropped organic chemistry II. Now, I'm just taking cell and molec with gen eds. I thought that, since I dropped ochem, I would have more time to focus on getting a good grade in bio alone, but that clearly did not happen with the first exam. I was above the average, but it was still only a C+ and my prof doesn't curve. I feel like such an idiot because there are people who are in both ochem II and cell & molec who probably did better than me.

Help needed... how could I get back to college?,"Hello everyone, so here is my story that I decided to share because I really am finding no way out...so two years ago I graduated from high school. During the senior year I made some awful decisions applying colleges. Therefore, I only got enrolled into an oversea university. My high school grade wasn’t bad at all (3.7 gpa and over 1450 sat) so I was couldn’t accept the reality at the time. I didn’t plan to go to community college nor oversea, so I planned to take a gap year and reapply to colleges during the following year. Another reason for taking a gap year is because my family was in turmoil at the time, and I need to take care of my mom who was diagnosed with breast cancer… For the first half of my gap year, I was doing okay. Since I was always passionate with writing, I found a job doing journalistic works for a website. I earned some money and was also trying to figure out my goal for life. However, as the time moves toward December, my mother’s condition worsened. I didn’t have a good time working with my boss and had no time to continue working. I also had many doubts about what I really want to do for life, and my once determined ambition became hesitant... Anyway, I wasn’t in any mood to go back to school and missed the deadline to apply to colleges. Then 2018 came, and it was such a dark time for me I didn’t want to talk much about it. Basically I got so hopeless about my life I was staying home taking care of my mother and crying... I was seeking treatment for my depression and didn’t earn any college credit for an entire year. In the beginning of 2019, my mom’s condition became better, and we decided to move to a different city. I also decided not to waste my time anymore though still feeling constantly swallowed by the thought that I could never go back to college again after two gap year. I have also found a job in New York writing and translating for a foreign media. Now we finished moving and have saved enough money for any future college I want to go. However, I don’t know if any non-community university would accept me after three gap years. I am starting to earn college credits through online college although I don’t know if any university would accept it. By the end of the year I shall earn about 12 credits. So as a person who went through depression, I want to ask is there a way I could get my life back? How should I explain the blank period (in which I didn’t earn any college credits) in my life without speaking too much about my depression? It is truly too painful for me to talk about it, and I feel like I lost a part of memory associated with it since my brain hurts every time I am trying to recall the time. Nonetheless, I bet the admission officers will be very interested about it, so anyone got through a similar time and have any advice? Thank you so much!",5,1,12.199970609449126,college

I have been editing this post to this effect: I am very thankful for the advice, yet notice that many responses include some variation of ""wear whatever you personally like.""

I don't know what works for me when it comes to studying and now I'm freaking out.,"My past attempts at college, I gained a 1.53. I'm taking a psych 101 class, and it is my first class that isn't going to let me use notes for the tests. I've been doing great in all the other classes that allow me to use notes. Remembering high school and that I wasn't allowed to use notes, I did terrible enough to have to drop out. So being the genius that I am, I decided to give note cards a try since I can play around with them, sort them into different categories and what not to try and build a connection with the concepts. I ran them past my teacher to make sure I was learning the right things.

Cue the next class. It's about learning and remembering things. One of the talking points is that using note cards doesn't work. BUT he makes a point to look at me and say ""but if it works for you, do it"". Mind you, this person has most likely seen my GPA because they are one of the heads of the school's phi beta kappa chapters and most likely think I've been using note cards the whole time. So now I'm not sure what to do, and I really don't want to make this dude more pissed than he seemed to be when I knew a few of the basic beginner stuff at the beginning of the class and then later going to him with note cards.

He is on vacation till next week and my test is on Tuesday, so I'm not going to be able to talk to him about this (or if it really would help if I could).

Do I start over and consolidate my notes? Do I continue using note cards and hope for the best? Is there a third option I don't know about?",10,6,12.276220609449124,college

Expository Essay: Travel (HELP!),"I am completing an expository essay for my English 045 class, and I am stuck on how to smoothly transition the topic to make a paper of 450-550 words. 

Topic: How people's outlook changes as a result of travel.  
Thesis: Travelling to different countries and experiencing other cultures and values provides people with a different outlook on life, teaches them value, and offers an escape from their daily lives.  
Supporting Statement 1: Once people have travelled for the first time, they begin to see the world with a new outlook.  
SS2: Travelling tends to broaden peoples perspectives so they learn to value experiences over material possessions.  
SS3: Having some distance from stress allows people to relax so they can think more clearly.

So far, for my Introductory Statement, my teacher says to make it so that it grabs the readers attention and reels them in so that I can lead them into my supporting statements.

So far for my introduction I have: Travel allows people to see and experience the world so that they can establish informed opinions about the countries they visit. Once people realize that other countries have different cultures and values, they begin to appreciate what they have taken for granted. Not all countries have resources such as transportation or communication. For example, there are people in third world countries who live in mud houses and do not have access to fresh water. Therefore, travelling to different countries and experiencing other cultures and values provides people with a different outlook on life, teaches them value, and offers an escape from their daily lives.",0,1,12.338130331671348,college
Wondering if it's worth trying more college after already getting a 4 year degree,"I recently graduated from a 4 year university in May with a bachelors in Communications. During my time there, particularly my senior year, I realized that I did not want do go into the fields that Comm majors typically go into. Cue panic and nearly dropping out because I did not know what to do with my life. Had to drop my part time job during my last semester to focus through the stress. Thanks to supportive friends and family, I finished my senior year and graduated with honors.

During that year I thought often about what I wanted to do or at least try. I love being creative - drawing, writing, etc. I've also had an interest in making video games, dabbling with it here and there but lacking a real foundation of programming experience to take it further. Homework took up a lot of my free time in college so I didn't get the chance to sit down and practice that skill. So I thought ""maybe I want to try doing programming."" I couldn't program because I was taking communication classes and my comm homework took up all my time! So making the homework programming would help, right? Well, sort of.

I enrolled myself in a program at community college and started there this fall - 15 credits. On top of this, I started an internship, 20 hours a week. However, the combination of the internship and the classes has left me just as stressed as I was back at the other college during my senior year. I've been doing exceptional in my classes but the workload and going to work has ultimately drained me. Again, homework takes up all my free time and leaves me little to no time to apply what I'm learning in my classes to what I want to do in the future - something either with video games or website development - let alone relax and decompress.

I'm at my wits end all over again. I feel like I overloaded myself with the internship and 15 credits of schooling but I feel like I can't drop the internship. Would it matter if I dropped the associates at this point since I already have a bachelors degree?

TLDR: would it be worth it to stick out an associates degree in programming to get the experience or should I cut my losses to focus on programming what I like in my free time, learning as I go, since I have a bachelors in communication already?",1,1,12.346949776115792,college
What is a good major to pair with Spanish?,"I got my associate's in Spanish almost 2 years ago, and my plan was to move onto a 4 year university and double major in Spanish and HR. Once I started looking more into business school though, I realized how unexcited I am about it, and how I would probably be torturing myself trying to get through the classes because they just don't interest me.

I still want to go back to school, but I've been told several times that studying Spanish on its own just isn't valuable enough. Now I'm really lost as to what to pick as my second major. I'm really horrible at science and math, which closes a lot of potential doors for me. The only thing I'm good at other than learning languages is writing. I did look into technical writing, but that seems like it would be best paired with a major other than Spanish. I also looked into Sociology since the statistics part of it could prove somewhat valuable, but I'm so bad at math that I don't know if I could ever be good enough at statistics for it to pay off.

My plan is to try to become a court interpreter, but just in case that falls through for any reason I thought it would be wise to have a second major to either fall back on or to strengthen my resume in general.

Can anyone give me some advice?",3,1,12.364993757597274,college

First-gen afraid of transferring to university,"I am 19 years old. I've been going to a community college for a little more than two years. I am finishing up my last quarter at this December and transferring to uni in January with my AA Degree.

While I've been attending community college I've been living with my parents. So when I transfer, it will be my first time living independently.

I am afraid of transferring, being a first-gen I can't ask my parents for advice on living alone or ask them about anything that worries me. So I feel like I am entering uncharted territories and I am afraid I won't be able to handle it. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and clinical depression (and I go to counseling), I've been handling it in college so far so good despite having severe panic attacks and finding myself in a bad spot.

But I am afraid that I won't be able to pick myself up if I get a panic attack, I am afraid of not having enough money to pay for my bills and I am afraid of not succeeding in college. My parents wouldn't be able to help me out either financially since they are in a bad spot economically.

"Worried about not being able to pay for school next year, what should I do?","Hey r/college,

I’m a junior in college and yesterday, I renewed my FAFSA. My mom is a single mother and according to her 2018 tax return, she earned approximately $50,000 last year. For context, she usually earns about $35,000 however, she worked a lot more hours last year. Because of this, my EFC more than doubled. (it was about 1500 before) I’m nervous that this is going to affect my financial aid, I live completely off my financial aid and my mother doesn’t help me, because quite frankly, she isn’t able to. This year, my mom’s hours have been cut and she’s obviously not making $50,000/year anymore. If my financial aid isn’t sufficient enough to pay for school, what are my options? Is their ways to appeal to CalGrant / Pell Grant for more money?

My major,"I’m currently a high school senior and I am looking at possible majors for college. I’m really interested in chemical engineering and would really like to major in it. But my school of choice temple university doesn’t have a chemical engineering. My main question is: will  majoring in general engineering and minor in chemistry ( or even double major in engineering and chemistry) be equivalent to a chemical engineering degree. 

If you don’t think that’s a good idea, I was also wondering about industrial engineering. I hear some think it’s a lesser engineering degree but if I can make money, get a job, and enjoy my work I don’t really care. 

I don’t especially like any other temple engineering majors, but they also have bioengineering. I was wondering if that was similar to biomedical engineering, and if so that might be close enough to chemE for me. 

If non of these ideas work i was wondering if a degree in financial planning/ advising is a good degree. 

I basically just want a degree that utilizes my strengths, which are math and science, and chemE seems perfect but I’m really intent on going to temple. I also want to see that I’m making a difference in a company or people’s lives.

The freezer is full of his food so I can't put anything in there. The kitchen bar counter is covered in his random jars of food and dishes that he doesn't have room to put anywhere because he filled every other cabinet with his other dishes and food.

What do you think of this class experience?,"This was a gen chem 2 class that lasted from early July to mid August. The professor had a PhD in chemical engineering, so he was a smart guy. In the beginning of the class there was about 45 people but at the final only about 25 people so many people dropped. 


At the end of almost every class was a short quiz about whatever we learned the previous day. One special example of this was that one time the prof gave us a quiz, and he let the whole class do it together. The quiz had 2 open ended math questions, so the class split itself to do the questions. The next day the prof said that everybody got the entire quiz wrong. 


He had a very heavy emphasis on the online homework, which had a 45% weight. The homework was comprised of about 150 questions for each chapter. The homework was all due at the end of the semester, which the prof also repeated often. 


I had an overall final average of a 75.4 (C), but after the final curve, I ended up with an A- final letter grade.

I spent all of senior year set on majoring in Ethics and Public Policy (multidisciplinary in my university's case- basically it's political science with a bunch of tracks you can take in order to broaden your knowledge and give you a better skill set for the job field. It's primarily pre-law, but I was planning on doing a master's program afterwards and taking a job with local government). I find politics and law pretty interesting, but as soon as I stepped foot into my American Foreign Policy class as well as my American Philosophy class I could tell I was gonna hate it. It's five weeks in, and yeah, I do. I'm not totally sure why, but I know it's something I'm finding extremely boring and really difficult at the same time.

So, I'm beginning to make alternative plans. I've generally thought of myself as becoming an educator at some point. While I'd love to be involved in local government, I have a huge pull towards my school's English program (my school is well known for their prestigious English and Creative Writing programs). I really want to become an English teacher; I got a 35 on the English sections of the ACT and a very high score on the writing portion, and I've always had a huge inclination towards reading comprehension and writing. All my APs were English and Social Studies related.

I guess my questions are this, directed at English Education or similar majors but anyone is welcome to answer: I haven't had the time to actually read a full book in years, because I've been so focused on my social studies classes and classwork. However, I've never been in an English or a Literature class that I didn't absolutely love and excel in. Would I have trouble if I haven't been an avid reader for some time?

Also, is the path toward becoming a teacher a difficult one? I know that despite the stereotypes about English, there are no ""easy"" majors, and obviously I won't always *love* my classes, but I think I'll at least be doing something that will get me into a career that I'm passionate about. I'm not totally sure what the job market is like for teachers right now, but as long as I can support myself and a family, I'm 100% all in with it. I don't care about the money as long as I'm comfortable and doing something I know I'm making an impact in.

Thoughts? Sorry, I know this was rambling, but I'd appreciate some input.",4,3,12.79771366500468,college

Thinking of changing my major from Business Admin to Public Relations & Advertising,"I go to a prestigious private university. I wish to become a ""serial entrepreneur"" one day and develop passive income as taught in Rich Dad Poor Dad. My heart was never in my business degree. I transferred from community college and do not like the BA curriculum at the university. I have finished my general ed and won't lose too many credits switching. I have been working for two years as a Stage Manager, have good public speaking skills, and have strengths in paper writing and creative writing. I am thinking of changing my degree to ""Public Relations and Advertising"" because they encourage more creativity and communication, but I want to make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot as a future entrepreneur.

In the business courses like accounting and management, I realize I am going to hire an accountant, not become a CPA for my business. Many different aspects of entrepreneurship taught in classes I am already familiar with through books like How to Get Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad. I read a lot of self actualization and have a vast interest in different things.

"Do I Really Owe $1,000?","So. I didn’t receive my financial aid in time to register for classes. I still don’t have it since my high school hasn’t sent over my transcript, and you can’t get financial aid without a transcript sent over. 

Because of this, it was past the add/drop date to enter classes. 

I was advised to ask the professors themselves to put me into their classes since an adviser couldn’t put me in classes nor could I, since it was a week late. 

However, I automatically get dropped at midnight if I don’t pay. This happened for all my classes. I was dropped from them all. 

I got put in the classes again by my professors when they noticed I got dropped. I realized I would just get dropped again since I couldn’t pay for it, so I decided to do it myself instead of wait until midnight.

Big mistake. 

Instead of automatically getting dropped, it showed up as a withdrawal — which means now it’s a W on my transcript and I have to pay for the class since it was past the drop date. 

Except, I got added past the drop date and dropped the next day anyways. I was going to be dropped at night by the system regardless and wouldn’t have been charged. 

Can I just explain this to my adviser? Obviously I don’t want to pay $1,000 for 3 classes I was going to be dropped from anyways. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) 

TL;DR: I withdrew from classes that I was going to be dropped from (free of charge) and now I have to pay for them since I dropped them myself instead of letting the system drop me. Can I get out of that?",3,1,12.893928942782459,college

Has anyone ever taken an exam with ProctorU?,"So I’m an online graduate student taking Statistics. The final exam for my class can either be taken in person (I live 4 hours from campus) or at home using ProctorU. My college has decided to use ProctorU, not my actual professor. 


I do not like the idea of it at all. Paying $20 to let some stranger watch you through your webcam as you take a test? Not to mention I have to grant them access to my personal computer and allow them to see my space around me. No posters on my walls or papers anywhere. Should I just undecorate my house?

No, I’m not someone who cheats on exams, but it is open book and we are allowed to use our course materials, which ProctorU does not allow. 

The whole idea of it gives me so much anxiety and I do not see how I will pass the exam with someone watching me for two hours...Plus it’s a total invasion of personal privacy in my opinion. I’m literally doomed to fail.

Looking for some help getting a friend back into her former college next year.,"So my friend had to leave the college we mutually attend last year due to personal issues. She wanted to return this year, but once again family/financial concerns got in the way.

As long as her current business contracts last (she will know this by January) she will be able to return to our college, at least from her side. In order to get re-admitted, she needs to form some kind of academic transcript to present to our college.

Due to personal circumstances and her belief until way past traditional schools’ app deadlines that she’d be returning this year, she was not able to apply to attend any kind of traditional institution for the fall 2019 semester. She’s not a huge fan of online college, but understands that it may be her only option if all else fails.

She’s asked me for help in this task of hers. So, after doing my own research and coming up with not much aside from online colleges, I’m turning to reddit. 

Are there any traditional colleges that are still accepting applications for the spring 2020 semester? It is necessary for the college to offer short semesters (8 week) since she needs a transcript by April 1. She lives in northeastern Texas, and wants to be able to commute from home.

In the realm of other possibilities, what else exists?

I was kicked out of college for being depressed,I'm not looking for advice or reassurance I just wanted people's opinion on their decision and if they were correct in making their actions. So I entered University as a Computer engineer in fall 18.

I've had an interest in film and photography since I was a kid and I still own an expensive camera and shoot with my friends all the time. I called my dad and told him that I wanted to switch to film because even if the salary is typically lower I will find more success in something that I like doing. He rejected it immediately and said that film is only a hobby and should only be done after you have done your education and gotten in a job in a traditional major. At this point I started to become severely depressed because I thought that I would never find success here and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I started to miss class and soon I completely stopped going and I never left my dorm. At the end of my term I received a 0.0 GPA and was dismissed. I appealed to the department in person and they told me that I should have dealt with my depression immediately and they didn't think I deserved a second chance. They mentioned that I was an adult now we have to take action when there was a problem and couldn't let depression stop me from seeking help.

My classmates are cheating on tests. What do I do?,"A bit of background, I'm a senior in an EET program, and the class is a senior-level EET specific course. The tests in this course are open notes, meaning you can use any reference materials such as the book, class notes, or worksheets, but offline only.

The last exam of the semester was extremely difficult, and as an A student I was shocked at how few problems I was able to have full confidence in solving. I know for a fact that I'm not going to be even close to an A, and this will likely cause me to receive a B in the course, and losing my 4.0 GPA. I knew that since I was the top student in the class that everyone else must've had trouble as well.

I asked other students (who I know quite well, since they're in the same program) how they did on the test. Two of them (out of a 12 person class) told me quite boldly that they brought in an answer key of the test from a past semester. They said they did well using it. The professor doesn't check what people bring it as a reference, so people did so with impunity. The chances are high that more than those just those two cheated.

STEM degrees and the job market in my area-,"I get so annoyed at being told something along the lines of “STEM is where the jobs are”  “learn to code” “learn computer programming”

Unless your a Dr, a PA-C, a Nurse, Occupational or Physical therapist,  a Veterinarian then no, your not gonna find work out here with a STEM degree.  There's like maybe 25-30 STEM opened fields in my area, (unless your willing to drive/move 100+ miles away) and about 300 people fighting over them.   STEM is just for us- an over saturated field with too many applicants and far to few openings.

Degrees in Public Policy, Family Counseling, Constriction Management, Hotel/Restaurant Management, Business Management, anything to do with HR, Education for K-12, Healthcare Management/Healthcare Administration, diesel mechanics, Criminal Justice, a degree in Law, anyone with a CDL license, a degree in culinary arts/cooking, and considering we're also surrounded by several state parks that are home to old growth forests and wet lands plus a federally produced rainforest (unless Trump gets his way) any degree related Forrest Management is just as big.

Major in Chemistry or Biology? If I want more than just a part time summer job with the forestry service-it's not happening. 

STEM degrees, at least where I live, isn't very marketable and honestly, your sorry ass is gonna make more money as an assistant manager at one of the casinos or a Park Ranger than you are as a computer programmer.

My section of 44 people is allowed to have 2A's. Class scores were posted online - the top scores in the section are 58.1%, 56.3% (ME), and 56.2%. I just received notice he's offering the 3rd place person extra credit, which is completely fucking unfair. He claims it's because she always went to office hours, tried hard,asked questions, etc and I didn't. Too fucking bad, I still beat her.

This would ruin my 4.0 which is unacceptable. I confronted him about this and he kept getting more and more defensive. I talked to the professor and wrote a letter to the dean; nothing has happened so far. Eventually I accused the the  third place girl of fucking him for a better grade and he kicked has refused to talk to me since.

I have a meeting with the department head tomorrow. Hopefully the dean contacts me soon too. What else can I do? Contact the TA's graduate advisor?",11,0,2126.4105460725364,college

Please turn in cheaters,"I see cheating defended too often in this subreddit. 

For those of us that are honest and on the fence, I urge you that if you catch someone cheating, don't ignore it and hope they will get their comeuppance.

Become the comeuppance. Tell your professor. You can do it by email or in private in their office hours. If you can get evidence even better.

Don't let cheaters ace the class for nothing while you are putting in the hard work to succeed and learn. Don't let them devalue your degree. So please everyone who has even an ounce of morals, turn in your cheaters. Be an honest person. Don't believe that they will eventually get their just desserts when you can give it to them. 

The only way they will learn is if they face the consequences of their actions and the only way they can face them is if they are turned in by honest students like you.

Edit: I see the cheaters are in full force with their downvotes 

Edit2: If you don't feel comfortable naming specific students at least let your professor know that cheating is happening so they can be more vigilant on their next exam or take measures to prevent it.",23,6,318.7311247762403,college
List the top 10 most disgusting events of your college experience.,"My top ten 10

-I went to one of the top party schools in the country.  It also attracted a lot of students from blue collar families.

-with that in mind here is my list. 

10. Sex in the quiet study room.  [Hey, it had 4 walls and a lock on the door! The smell was unbearable and there were frequently used condoms lying about, this was eventually closed to students]

9. Pissing in the elevator.  [There were only 2 urinals on our 5th floor bathroom. When we had parties there was always a line.  One day I found that my car trunk key fit the firefighter operation key in the elevator, same day 10 copies were made. We would stop the elevator on our floor during party nights and use it as a urinal, for my entire college experience that elevator smelled like piss]

8. Puke in the shower.   [This actually started the first night of the first semester I was in Oz.  It was at least a weekly occurrence.  The RD had meetings with us about this on a regular basis. Eventually we were all fined 10 dollars a week in damage fee's since no individual would admit doing it. We always blamed the floor below and above us]

7. Sex in the elevator.  [since the quiet study room mentioned in #1 was closed to students after heavy use, the handy elevator key was used to stop the elevator in between floors to have sex in.  Like the quiet study room it smelled like dirty sex and condoms were frequently left there.  One elevator was designated the piss elevator, the other was the sex elevator. The only annoying part about this was, couples would knock on your door at 3-4am looking for the key, after many late night occurrences more copies of the key were made]. 

6. Shitting in lounge chairs in the lounge.  [This was only really done by a few individuals, who probably had mental problems. But nonetheless, a few times people decided to shit in the lounge and use the curtains as toilet paper.  It's hard to get that smell out.]


5. Girl pissing on chairs. [There was a lovable girl down the hall we all called “slut box”.  She didnt mind the name and would introduce herself as such.  Slut box was named so because she was a 6 but after 20 beers looked a 10, and she would literally fuck anyone.  I don't think I had ever seen her turn anyone down, ever.  She was also a raging drunk.  On more than one occasion she would get black out drunk and pull her pants down and piss on a chair, in front of everyone.] 

4. Pissing on car door handles.  [I'm not sure how this game got started but in that part of upstate NY, it is very cold most of the winter.  A “joke” people used to play on each other was pissing on someone's car door handles so that it freezes and makes it so you can't open the car door up.  Then the car owner has to chip away the frozen piss. Eventually this activity waned after several arrests were made for doing this].

3. Shitting in the girls sink.  [A good friend of mine,  who  did a lot of other nasty things, one night decided to walk into an occupied girls bathroom and pull down his pants, sit in the sink and take a shit.  The girls screamed and tried hit him with things.  All the time he thought it was funny and would try to make conversation with them,  usually saying, “oh girls, its just a little poop”.  He would often victimize different floors and different buildings. After a few semesters he got caught and was sent counseling].

2. The cum throwing game.  [This game originally started as retaliation from a previous nights' teabagging incident.  The game consisted of this: you jerk off.  Keep the cum in your hand. Knock on your targets' door.  Throw your cum at him/her. Run.   Unlike snowballs  there is no readily available ammunition to shoot back after you are hit by someones cum.  Often a victim would be seen in the hallway corner cranking it, to produce throwing cum.  As the warfare progressed, assassination attempts were common. This is when you waited until a person sits down or was talking to someone, you come up behind them and wipe cum in their hair or face.   This brutal game lasted over a semester. On some occasions the “slut box” from #6 threw  used tampons or used condoms.   Slut box was attacked a lot because she took it well and frankly we knew she would not file charges against us. Eventually a truce was called, and ended the cum throwing game.

1. Piss filled snapple bottles breaking.   [BK, a kid that lived 5 doors down from me was a full blown alcoholic, meaning he would start drinking when he woke up and drink almost exclusively hard liquor. His beverage of choice was cheap vodka and snapple.  By the time the evening came he was raging drunk.  Often too lazy or too drunk to walk to the bathroom , BK would piss in a snapple bottle and then put the snapple bottle along the wall.  As the semester progressed, his Snapple bottle collection grew.  He was actually very proud of his piss wall collection and would show visitors to the floor. One night, when his collection was as wide as the the length of the room and almost as high as the ceiling, BK accidentally knocks over the piss snapple wall of bottles and they came crashing down and broke.  In a fit of rage he smashed what unbroken ones remained.  Due to the large volume of urine, the floor below got flooded by piss.  Both rooms had to be abandoned for an entire year due to the awful smell.  Our whole floor smelled of piss for quite awhile and his roommates possessions were destroyed including a laptop.  
BK was not well liked on the floor, since he would always drunk argue with you about stupid things, and would steal your alcohol.  Often he would ask people for a little booze while holding a red solo cup.  After  handing him the bottle he would fill the red solo cup to the rim with your liquor and walk back out.  If you protested he would accuse you of being an awful Nazi.  So when BK got kicked out of the school, no one protested. ]

How to do well in college: some basic strategy,"1. Take the general education courses at a community or cheaper state college.  
2. Take your general education courses first, stuff like com1, speech, and ""intro to"" classes.   
3. Do not take useless classes like ""student success skills"" that they'll try to talk you into.   
4. Never, ever, under any circumstance choose a class without first looking up the professor on ratemyprofessor.com. Some teachers are just really easy.   

5. Choose your classes on the day registration becomes available. The good teachers will be booked first. Don't wait until the last minute to register.   
6. Do all your homework and assignments on time (duh) and go to your schools learning lab to get help on assignments.    
7. If your school offers ""minimesters"", TAKE THEM! it's the 16 week course crammed into a 8 week time frame. But here's what happens in minimesters:  
a. The teachers don't want to be there for 3+ hours so you almost always get out early.   
b. Teachers underestimate the time they have so they assign less work.    
c. There's less homework because more is done in class and most teachers don't want to overload.   
   
Furthermore, minimesters allow you to fit more courses in a semester, achieve more credit hours and finish faster. Especially if you work and can only attend school 2 days a week. This is best for dumb classes like humanities and world religions that are necessary but not helpful to your degree.     
  
8. Doing the above should earn you a 4.0 GPA. Yes you may have pushed the harder classes until later but that's OK, because you have a 4.0 and teachers/advisers will now treat you with respect and bend over backwards for you because you are a value to the school.   
9. Join the honors program and honors society (phi beta kappa). You gets tons of opportunity when in phi beta kappa including scholarships and tuition discounts. You also meet people and teachers who have seniority and a lot of power in the school (they are usually honors teachers who earn that position through respect and/or are faculty leaders). If you are a socialite, befriend them, and get reference letters after class finishes. The references you receive will pull a lot more weight.   
10. You have a 4.0 GPA so you will try and fight for dear life to maintain it, knowing that a single B will forever plunge you into the 3.XX ranks. This is great motivation.   
  
These are some pretty obvious tips but I see other people in college who don't even look up their prospective teachers on ratemyprofessor. It's madness, especially on a class you don't exactly need for your career path. ",1,0,1411.0212173688328,college

"Moved to the USA and looking at courses I need to select to start my college life, I had a question:","So I moved to the USA some time ago,  grew up and went through the UK education system.  Anyway,  I work full time and thought I could do with learning some new stuff. 

I'm going through my first year and selecting core classes.

Now, I originally thought,  awesome,  as an engineer I get to study some classes I haven't done since high school..  History, Philosophy..  Subjects I enjoyed but didn't do at University as an engineer.  

Anyway,. Choosing my core history classes I'm left dumbfounded. 

Why are my only choices for history core classes the following:

-  US history to 1877 (women and gender)

-  US history to 1877 (African American) 

-  US history after 1877 (women and gender) 

-  US history after 1877 (African American) 

-  History of Texas

-  Mexican American history

- American women history 

-  Afro American history
    
    
     
Why has the school system decided that history has to be viewed from a feminist or african American perspective? Why can't I just study American history without the feminist liberal agenda?  

The only course that interests me is Texas history, I was really looking forward to studying the wars of independence and American history but  i am dumbfounded I am being forced to study it I'm regards to  feminist, Afro-American or Mexican history. 

For a country that has such an amazing short history,  I just can't begin to understand why I am being limited to such a small perspective.

The Government Took Away My Ability To Go To School. Any Alternative Suggestions?,"Long story short, I was charged for posession of a controlled substance (my own prescription of adderall) on my college campus. Now that I have a misdemeanor drug charge, I lose my ability to receive financial aid. They also took away my driver's license.

I also had a startup in a local incubator, providing technolgy services to senior homes and its residents. This includes teaching seniors how to use the Internet and protect themselves from Internet fraud and developing an automated nursing station to automate the process of recording vital signs. 

Since I can no longer receive FASFA, I cant go back to school and me being in incubation was contigent on retaining student status, so I also lose my startup. Since they also took away my driving privileges, I cant even go find a job.

How To Talk To Your Crush In Lecture Hall,"The start of new semester not far in the future means new classes, new people and new class crushes. We all have our special reasons (or someones) for going to class, and it  isn't because we are actually interested in hearing what the professor has to say. 

So when you walk into your first class in the next couple of weeks and find that special cutie to actually show up to and dress like a human for, here's how to break the ice (and it doesn't include any polar bears). 

1. “I heard the professor is really hard.”

Ask if they have read the reviews on the professor. Make up a bogus ‘friend of a friend’ who took the class. The more elaborate story, the better.

2. “Are you taking this class for your major/general requirements?”
Whatever their answer, reply with “Oh, me too. What major? Which requirement?”

3. “Did you get the textbook for this class yet?”
There’s a reason for #brokecollegestudent. Your whole budget and barista paycheck and summer savings all somehow end up going to the five textbooks your professor put on the syllabus but won’t actually even lecture from. No matter what their major, all college students minor in complaining.

4. “Is this seat taken?”
This is also an excuse to show up to class a little late. If you’re not ready to jump into introductions, ask if you’ve missed anything yet.

5. “Do you know if he put the syllabus up somewhere?”
Pretend you never heard where the professor actually put it. Even if you’re one of those that have it printed out and hole-punched in a binder for the first day of class, just don’t and ask so they can now tell you what’s on the syllabus.

6. “Are you a –whatever- year?”
Follow their answer up with a, “Oh I just heard that all –whatever- years take this class? I don’t know, I mean I’m a –whatever- year”. That’s usually enough to start off the recycled topics of “How do you like it? What else are you taking? and Do you live in the dorms?”...

7. “Hey, weren’t you in my psych class last semester?”
Make up some characteristic you ‘remember,' so it sounds less like a line at a frat party. “Yeah, didn’t you always sit at the back of the class?"" When they say no, just laugh and let them know they have a twin on campus.

8. “Did you see that game?”
If you don’t actually know of any games, just hope they do. Who knows? You might get lucky (in more ways than one).

9. “Which TA do you have?”
Move the conversation to share about last semester’s TA from hell. Everyone’s had one of those.

10. “Do you know when the activities fair is?”
Ask about any school event – advanced screening, football game, Chinese Student Union dumpling night mixer. You can even pull out your phone and pretend a friend texted you to ask. You might even work an invite into the conversation if it goes well!",9,12,2469.2730576466106,college

"Take home final. Expects us to use the ""Honor Code"" and not look at notes or books. Facing a moral dilemma.","So, my international law professor has decided to make the final an online exam that we have a 24 hour period to complete. Once we start the exam, we only have 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete it, but we have between a 24 hour period to start it. Now, most take home exams I know allow for the usage of notes, but she wants us to use the Honor Code and not cheat or look anything up at all while doing this exam. I really like my professor and I don't want to go against her instructions, otherwise I'd feel terrible. However, I *know* that some people are going to cheat, and since the class is presumably based off a curve, this is going to fuck me over in the end. I'm not sure what to do.

College professor is forcing us to pay 120 bucks for 50% of our grade.,"So my classes just started today and I was met with a paywall IMMEDIATELY with one course.

They have a software called MindTap from: MindTap® Computing, 1 term (6 months) Instant Access for Carey/DesJardins’ New Perspectives Microsoft® Office 365 & Excel 2016: Comprehensive 

They state in their first module that this software will be 50% of our final grade. If we do not buy, we will fail.

How. The. Absolute. Fuck. Is this not wrong???

Some of us cannot even fucking pay our rent on time while juggling school and work....and they expect us to pay out the ass for software that only lasts 6 months???
The worst part is, the software really only gives you access to an online PDF of the book....WHICH I ALREADY FUCKING HAVE BECAUSE FUCK PAYING FOR A BOOK IM ONLY GOING TO FUCKING USE 3 GOD DAMN PAGES OUT OF.

How to throw a banger party? Insane budget,"Hey guys! Alright, I'm looking to throw an absolute banger party. I practically have an unlimited budget.

The house is pretty big, two stories. Back yard kinda sucks, no pool. It's a large open area though. I'm out here in Dallas.

Alright, so I've only thrown a few low key parties, but I want this one to be an absolute banger. Here's my list so far.

1. Pro DJ
2. Special effects, lights, etc. (Def gonna get a dry ice fog machine for the end, floor looks sick with it)
3. Assortment of alcohol, was thinking maybe I could get a bartender from hooters...? Sounds like a fun idea. Maybe not lol.
4. I'll cater some nice food like BBQ, it's messy though so I'm not sure. But some bomb food for sure.
5. Pool table & Foosball table. Thinking of some PS4's through the house and some VR.

What’s everyone thoughts of the notion “college is a scam” I need help!,"Some background ....

My brother recently dropped out of college, really no reason why, a week before class was gonna start he came to my parents and I and said he doesn’t want to go anymore. He’d rather be a claims adjuster (this was all very random and just came out of nowhere). My parents, myself and a few others tried to understand why but I guess the idea of college to him is a scam and doesn’t like it. 

We are coming up on November and he still has made zero progress to try something else. Whether it be a trade school or what have you. He hasn’t done anything in the meantime to find something else. 

We’re 22 and he’s in this idea that his career will fall outta the sky in front of him. My dads a barber and owns his own business and we even tried to talk to him about going to barber school and no. 

He wants to sit back, make money and not really “work”. 

I’ve heard the cliche of “college isn’t for everyone” and that’s fine but you have to find something else right?

Is college really a scam? He’s been listening to countless number of people who sort of feeds this notion into his head as well.

Sound off everyone. I’m totally up for everyone’s thoughts!

"To all those worried about ""unemployability"" in pursuing the major they love","I have been in love with philosophy for a long time(thus, my username), but have been discouraged and deterred from the idea of studying it extensively, both by my parents, by society, and by my own pragmatic thought, derived from the stigma philosophy has. But when I came across articles like this : 

http://pleasandexcuses.com/2012/09/06/philosophy-major/ 

and started reading 1950s literature, I realized just how stupid I had been.

Oftentimes, young people are discouraged from enriching themselves in the process of studying something that genuinely interests them, and because of this, they opt to major in something like business, or mathematics, or computer science, not because they enjoy it, but because they believe it will get them a job quickly, and a high-paying job, at that.

To those people, I highly recommend that you go out right now and read Arthur Miller's play, *Death of a Salesman*. It may be what is necessary to express clearly to you the deep truth that pursuit of money for money's sake does not bring happiness.

And the thing is, if you do what you love, you're *not* unemployable. You're probably *more* employable than those who chase a degree in business for employability's sake. Rather than becoming mediocre in a field that will consistently make you wish you were grinding your ear with a cheese-grater, you can improve yourself to excellence in an area that you truly enjoy. In the article about the utility of studying philosophy I've shared, it describes a number of skills that the degree develops in those who choose to pursue it.

They are not limited to philosophy. A History major, an English major, a Political Science major, hell, a major in almost any of the core liberal arts will cultivate those skills in you, and a major in any of those -- if you truly love it -- will, *without fail*, teach and prepare you more for adult life than the study of anything you have apathy for will.

Edit: It seems that meaning of this post may be unclear. I am *not* advocating for reckless decision-making -- my *sole purpose* in writing this all is to advise people not to be deterred from something they really want to do based solely on financial security. ",32,1,1990.234515979944,college

TIFU- talking my way into a parking ticket with my University’s campus police!,"Last week I was trying to get to my proper parking lot area that I had bought tags for over the summer. To explain things, I bought a parking tag for the university’s “C” lots (commuter parking). 

I had an early afternoon class, and the lot was full, and I didn’t feel like circling until somebody gave up their spot, so I decided to park in the “P” lots (Perimeter lots). I figured if anything I ripped myself off for that particular day because the P lot passes are cheaper than commuter passes. I also figured the campus police wouldn’t care. 

Wrong! 

I got done with my only class, which was econometrics, and came back to my car to see a white slip under my wiper blade. I opened it up, and it was just a warning. For whatever reason, I thought “how stupid is this?” And I decided to make an appearance into the PD service center in the campus union. 

I was talking with the officer in the service center about this, and she was a bit befuddled by this encounter, and offers to call in the police officer who issued the warning. I accepted it, and the guy comes in about 5 minutes later. I shake his hand, and basically asked for clarity on the warning, and why it matters so much as to which lot I park in. I follow up by bringing up the point that the P lot is never at capacity and the commuter lots are. 

The officer just calmly explains that parking in the lot you didn’t buy permits for, no matter how cheap, isn’t fair to those who did buy them. I asked what he meant, and gave me an opposite scenario, where someone with a P permit decides to park in the C lots then they’re going to get a citation. 

At this point, I should’ve taken my L and left, but no I just kept rambling on. I made a point to the officer that I’m not going to wait for others to clear a parking space for me, and that I’m going to continue parking in the P lot because of it never being at capacity. 

The officer says to me “ok, that’s fine, do you have a second?” I told him I’m done with classes for the day, and he tells me to hangout for a second. It felt like a long time had pass when I was in this service center, and I asked the lady behind the desk if it would be cool if I left. She says to me that it wouldn’t matter at this point. 

I asked what she meant, and she just says that my car is in the system since the day I bought the parking tags, and I gave her a “uhh?” By then the officer came back to the office and he had a brand new slip of paper for me, this time it was an actual citation. The officer follows up by saying “for you, this will be a better reminder than a warning for the consequences of parking in the wrong area.” 

Moral of the story, if you get a ticket for whatever reason by your campus PD, just stay quiet, and take the L if the infraction was for a valid reason. ",8,2,413.4747011651292,college

Being questioned about your convictions, and being able to rationally and intellectually respond is a precept for critical thinking skills. Admitting your position is wrong is also important if the logically laid out argument is right and forces you to reconsider your position, and thus grow.

I truly want to know if this is what higher education has turned into; because quite frankly, reality will hit you like a ton of bricks as soon as you graduate.

16 ways how top students study by Loy Machedo,"I have had the honor and privilege of mentoring students who applied for a few Top Ivy League Colleges. And I even have 2 clients who are currently at Harvard. So given my interaction with them here are some of the pointers I feel will help you become a Top Student yourself.

**1. Very Clear Cut Goal**  
Almost every Top Notch performer I have worked with has a very clear cut goal stated IN WRITING. They have this goal pasted on top of their study table, in the toilet, on a notice board in the house, and some of them even have a piece of paper in their pocket. That is the kind of obsession they have with their goal.   
  
- It is very clear. It is very specific. They have the date, the time, the number - whatever possible to make the goal as clear, as specific, as measurable and as powerful as possible. For instance - I have met a peak performer who stated “I want to run fast” rather I have met people who achieved their goal as “At the Dubai Half Marathon on 3rd December 2017, I will run 21kms in 1 hour 59 minutes”.   
  
- And once they create and craft their goal - they work backwards to where they are currently at the moment.   
  
- Top notch students have a long term strategy where they are, where they wish to go and they even know why they want to get there.

**2. Long Term Plan**
I have yet to meet a student who just planned out his future for one year. But I have met many Top notch performers who have clearly stated a long term strategy. For instance students have a clear cut goal of what their future is going to be like I will take up science stream with specialization in 123, from there I will pursue a career as a doctor who will specialize in XYZ, from the University of ABC. And after that…..”  
  
It is never a 6 months or 1 year goal. Never. It is always a career plan that is carefully and intelligently crafted for a lifetime.

**3. Backup Plans**
There is a certain thrill that comes from having an outlandish goal and achieving it. And don’t we all love to have a underdog success story! However, smart & practical people know that there is always a possibility that they may fail. So even though the student (or competitor) goes Kamakazi with a “Do or Die” attitude in heart, there is always a smart strategy being kept alive in their mind - that is in case failure comes knocking on their door. So that is where not just Plan (A) is in effect, there is always a Plan (B) kept secretly intact. And if Plan (B) doesn’t work, there is a Plan (C).

**4. 100% Family Support**  
If there is one criteria I feel is exceptionally important - it would be this one. You cannot - just cannot succeed in your goal to become a Top Student if you have an environment that doesn’t support your goal.   
  
Imagine trying to study in a noisy house where everyone is watching TV or having fun with their friends. Almost every Top Student I worked with - the Mother, the Father and the entire family was behind the youngster. You need this kind of support every single day - day-in and day-out.   
  
I have literally known parents who wake up with the young child in the morning (at 2am) prepare his/her breakfast and then go to sleep. At 5am drive the child to extra classes. After classes, the child is taken to school. En the breakfast is given. Once school is done with - again the child is picked up and brought home. Once at home - lunch, a 1 hour nap - and back to studies. And after that a break - rest and then back to studies with another tutor. Finally dinner and sleep. Throughout the entire schedule - the parent - both the Father and Mother ensure that the child is being supported towards this one goal.

 **5. Consistency **
You can not and I mean CANNOT achieve Top Notch Status if you are not consistent. It is not about taking the book for one day - reading it for 18 hours and thats it. Day after day after day the student takes up his book to study, learn, research and focus completely on his goal - to become Number 1. And there are some whom I have known to be consistent towards their goal for 12 years - which calls for incredible consistency.

**6. Total Immersion & Obsession**
If you want the 1st step and only step among everything else towards being a Top Notch Student - it would be this one ingredient. The level of Immersion (being involved and into something) and the amount of Obsession (Crazy Focus) with regards to their goal in life is beyond human. 

I remember meeting this young girl (South Indian) at my residence. Her parents had brought her to me with regards to preparing her for a Presentation. No matter what I asked her - even casually, there was only one answer, one priority, one focus - she wanted to be Number 1 in her college with the highest marks. 

When I asked her what her hobbies were, when I asked her what she did in her spare time and even when I asked her what she liked - there was only one answer - To succeed in her goal of being the Number 1 student. Even though I felt it was a bit extreme - but I was blown away with the intensity and her focus. And mind you - by speaking to her for a few minutes - I knew 100% she would achieve her goal no matter what. 

So if you want to be a Top Notch student - this element is paramount.

**7. Smart Choices of Friends**
Here is a Pop Quiz for you - 
Choose one. 

- Do you think a Rank Holder will spend time with Rank Holders who are focused on their goals of achieving Number 1 status in College, those who are studious and who love studies OR
- Do you think a Rank Holder will spend his time Dropouts, youngsters who are addicted to substances, those who have no interest in Education or in being the best?

Which one do you think makes more sense?

Remember - Mix Hot & Cold water and what do you think happens? Keep someone healthy with a bunch of unhealthy people - what do you think will happen? 

Keep this much in mind - Bankers hang around with Bankers, Scientists hang around with people of science, Bikers hang around with other fellow Bikers and Marathoners hang around with people who run Marathon. So what kinds of people you think Top Students would hang around with? In fact - ask yourself - What kinds of people would the parents of such Top Students would allow their children to be surrounded with?

**8. Smart Choices of Execution**
I get tons of ideas sent to me every single day on how to achieve a goal or a business or a new venture. And I always tell them one simple thing - Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. For entering into the elusive world of being called a “Top Student” - its not just theories and plans that are focused upon - the execution of these plans are studied, researched and implemented. That is why some of the parents end up at my doorstep because they are searching for that ‘something new’ or that something ‘extra’ which will push their child towards success. 

So you must have ‘action’ and not just theory if you are looking to be a Top Student. And that action should be implemented not only by the Student but by the Parent also.

**9. The Power Habits**
How many times did you check your smartphone for notifications?
How many hours did you study?
What time did you wake up?
Which professor did you consult today?
How many classes have you attended during the year?

I have personally noticed that Top Students do not have any habits or engage in any activity that takes them out of their zone or away from their goals. 

You are a creature of your habits. And you cannot achieve any success in any endeavor if you do not have powerful habits. And Top Students have Powerful Habits.

**10. Self Evaluation Feedback Loop**
How would you know if a supplement offers you the benefits it says it delivers? How would you know if an exercise is truly helping you become better, faster, stronger and more competitive? How would you know if the new coach you appointed is the right coach for you?

You evaluate it through a test or you check it through constant & acute observations. 

Top notch Students constantly have tests and exams to know where they stand, how much they understood, what did they understand, where they weak points are and where they need to improve on. And it is not just one time but every single week and every single month that such tests are undertaken. 

The reason for this - they are very clear about the pace, the speed and the performance they are looking for. And just as if you had a terrible or miserable performance throughout the year during the trials - you cannot become a star suddenly on the day that it truly matters - in the same way Top Students ensure they are 100% battle tested every single moment.

 **11. Sacrifices**
I recently watched the Indian Movie Dangal (Dangal (film) - Wikipedia ) A very powerful and inspirational sports biopic staring Indian Superstar Aamir Khan where he narrates the story of how Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan) ensures both his daughters become India’s first world-class female wrestlers. 

You should seriously watch the movie in its complete entirety. An exceptionally powerful movie. What I really loved about this movie was the depiction of how sacrifice was clearly shown to be the underlining factor that pushed this family and these two girls to achieve their dreams. 

I personally had moments of tears when watching this movie because it was so real. So the point I am trying to make here is - without sacrifices - truly heartbreaking and intensely blood churning sacrifices - you cannot - just cannot achieve success. Or for that matter become A Top Notch Student.

**12. The Extra Mile**
Even though I am not a Top Student where Academics is concerned, I consider myself a Top Student where my field of work is concerned which is Personal Branding, Communication & Peak Performance. And this has lead me from my simple humble beginning as an School Dropout Toilet Cleaner who started his career with nothing and no money - to being the World’s Best at what I do today - Personal Branding. And even though I am a South Indian with a South Indian accent - I have tutored and trained World Class Speakers. 

So how is this humanly possible?

It is possible because I followed one simple principle in life: 
“Never let anyone out prepare you”
If someone was practicing their speech 10 times, I choose to practice mine 100 times. If someone committed to 100 drafts, I would ensure my speech would go through 3,000 drafts. If I learnt that the industry standard while preparing a speech was 30 days before the actual speech performance - I would prepare my 365 days before the planned date. Such was my extreme planning, preparation & commitment. 

I never ever ever let anyone out-prepare me. And that is why I achieved success more than anyone else. 

If you can wake up and workout when the world is sleeping, if you can sacrifice all the pleasures of a good life just for your goal, if you can say no to others when everyone is calling you to have a good time because you need to focus on your goals - you my friend will achieve immortality.

 **13. Diet, Breathing & Meditation**
This may sound like a rather weird or unheard of combination. And to be honest, even I didn’t know this ingredient existed - however, once I started interacting with top-notch performers - I realized this was a very powerful component to the movers and shakers of our generation.

Most of the high performance achievers at Harvard, Yale & the top Ivy League schools are very particular what they eat, how much they eat and when they eat. Its not like they do not eat burgers, pizza’s and fries - but the majority are very particular about what they eat. And most of them eat to live - and not live to eat. Because end of the day - they have to get back to ‘work’. 

Where Breathing & Meditation is concerned - most of them given the amount of work they do - ensure they are able to reset their system and get back into the zone of work. And that is why they always spend time either Exercising light to ensure health and yes, Meditate to ensure their minds are fresh and powerful. 

There is nothing like having a powerful body and powerful mind as the ultimate combination.

**14. Routine**
I have stated this in almost every answer possible and nearly all successful have this particular ingredient - a Routine. 

If you haven’t read the routine I follow - here is the link:

- [Loy Machedo's answer to What is Loy Machedo's daily routine like?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Loy-Machedos-daily-routine-like/answer/Loy-Machedo)

To achieve that level of success - you must have a routine. Without this - forget it.

**15. Professional Coaching & Mentoring**
Sometimes I wish someone had told me how important this particular factor was - I really really really wish I knew this. Because had I known how powerful and impactful this particular aspect was towards success - I would have begged - literally begged my parents to get me a mentor. 

Almost ALL and I mean ALL successful people have mentors. If you have a mentor, with everything else being equal - your chance to success increases at least 1000% more than the person who doesn’t have a mentor. 

Need I say more?

 **16. Money Talks**
In the end - if there is one trait that is the most unfair and most painfully obvious - it would be this one - Money. Without money, you cannot get yourself into a world-class educational institute, you cannot get yourself world class facilities, you cannot get yourself a world-class mentor and you cannot get yourself into a world-class environment. Sad as it sounds - you need money to help you make more money. And without this - you will never - and I mean NEVER be able to achieve your dreams - at least easily. 

Yes, there have been students who have been awarded scholarships, but then again - how many do you think can boast of this rare privilege? And if you are looking forward to enter in Harvard or some top notch institute - do you see it being a cake-walk? 

You need this valuable resource. And it is only those who have planned for this day will be able to access and take advantage of the opportunities that present itself. Given the amount of competition, the number of people who want to succeed and the limited number of chances available - the person who has the money - will be able to take advantage than the person who doesn’t have any.

So I hope these pointers gave you some insight into what goes into being a Top Student. Let me know what you think about it in the comments section below. Would love to hear from you.

Pro tip: Don't trust the reviews on ratemyprofessors.,"The reviews should not be a factor that persuades you to choose a professor or not. You can literally write a review anonymously and no one will ever know if you had taken the class or not. You can also upvote/downvote a review 20+ times, resulting in a biased opinion that may seem legit, but is actually not.",19,3,248.02597431327732,college
PSA: “The college experience” does not exactly exist.,This is thrown out a lot. So many people say I want “the college experience”. College is not like the movies. Most days will be spent at home or at work either studying or just relaxing and watching tv. The environment and community of a school matters. However there is no like super mega fun time every day. Do not pick a school away from home if you cannot afford it because “I want the college experience” price and comfortability should be the two biggest factors of picking a school (assuming the school is already accredited). Staying home and saving tens of thousands will be worth a lot more than moving away and going into debt. ,2,4,417.0394233873514,college
My roommate has drugs in the room. I took action but im not sure if it was right.,"I moved in yesterday whereas my roommate moved in about a week ago. I brought my fridge up early and when i opened it yesterday there was a bottle of vodka. I talked to him about that and told him I didnt want it in the room. i came back later and the vodka was just in water bottles. 

I came back from a freshman convocation and I'm pretty sure he was selling it to a guy. Then later when i got back from another freshman thing there was a different guy in there. i saw him grab a lighter and a bag from his drawer and leave the room.

At that point i talked to the RA he told me to pour the alcohol out and get serious with him about not having drugs in the room. We got to a small catholic college and I'm here on an athletic scholarship, I don't want to lose that but i don't want to piss the dude off for no reason.

"Need advice, my roommate is gay and heterophobic, and I'm a straight guy.","So I just got my college room assignments recently, and it turns out my roommate is gay. This I have no problem with, he's just another guy in my mind who happens to like other guys.

The problem is that he's a self professed ""heterophobic"", even to me he's said this, and he views it as a sort of affirmative action and reverse discrimination in his eyes.

This deeply disturbs me, and as a straight male I understand that I could never truly understand the discrimination and prejudice gay people and all lgbtq have gone through in this country, but it still seems like a step in the wrong direction and definitely something that would make sharing a confined space with him for at least a year difficult.

He seems pretty firm about it, but claims he ""doesn't really care"". However, I care if I'm sharing a room with someone who has prejudice against me for my sexual orientation.

Should I request to change roommates? My college is weird and you have to room with people in your LLC which is only like 30 possible people so I don't know if it's even possible, or should I try to talk to him more about it and make the best of the situation?

Salty professor made me look stupid,"In class we were working a problem by ourselves and the professor was walking around the room looking at answers. She looked at my answer. She asked me what I got in front of the class and it was wrong. She said it's a common mistake and that's why she called on me. I told her I didn't like that she made me look stupid in front of the whole class. She could've just as easily told us the common mistake instead of throwing me under the bus. She said she didn't mean to make me look stupid and that everyone makes mistakes. I told her after class sorry and that it's just my ego and I hate being wrong. She said she noticed my ego and she called on me to try help me with humility. (I'm the top student in the class after getting a 100% on the first 2 exams). She said she doesn't know where I learned that mistakes aren't ok. I didn't argue and just said I bet you're right and left it at that. She said of course she is right. 

I feel like I might have a little ego problem, but she does too. Insisting she is always right and knows who I am, just last class I pointed out a mistake she made on the board.

But what about people who just casually have a beer, or people who drink socially? Personally, I think that beer and vodka tastes terrible.

Also I read how education abroad ""isn't that great"" but not sure how much of that statement is just ""Americanism"" or not, I mean unless you're at MIT a lot of colleges aren't that great even here right?

What are my chances of getting into a top tier school?,"I'm currently a junior in high school (Asian male, NJ, fairly high income bracket). I have a pretty good fallback plan (McGill, Canadian citizen but US resident) but I want to know the chances of me getting into a top tier school. By top tier I mean schools higher than the Duke, JHU, and Cornell tier of schools.   

My GPA right now is only a 3.70/4.56 due to a bad sophomore year. If everything pans out I should have around a 3.80 by application time. Class rank unknown as our school won't disclose it unless you need it for scholarships. My SAT is a 2400 (first try), no SAT 2s yet but I plan on taking Math 2 and Chemistry. (Not to sound arrogant but I expect to get 800s in both)  

I've taken 2 AP exams so far (Comp sci and Chinese(self study),  both 5s). This year I'm planning on taking Chemistry, Calc BC, English Language, US History, Macro economics, and Micro economics. (Again, I don't want to sound arrogant but our school prepares us for the exams very well and the vast majority of students get 5s so I expect to get 5s in all, I might get a 4 in macro/micro).

My high school is a very competitive public high school in NJ. We were ranked something like 11th in the nation for STEM fields and were pretty much the only non-magnet school in the top 50. Our average SAT was around 1900. There are a lot of very smart kids (5 kids so far have a 2400 and a lot have 2300+) and the teachers do expect a lot more out of the students than normal.    

For extra curricular activities I've been on varsity swimming for 4 years and will be captain next year. I did some assorted clubs my first two years but I didn't really like them so I've shifted to more out of school things. I'm currently an editor for an English language column in a local Chinese newspaper. Last summer I worked as a lifeguard and this summer I have a research internship at Rutgers University in biochemistry under a professor there. Throughout freshman and sophomore years I volunteered at the Chinese school doing mostly clerical work. I might also be able to volunteer at the American Cancer Society doing patient screening. I also represented NJ at the National Geographic Bee in 8th grade but I'm not sure that still has any bearing.

An important lesson for all incoming freshmen on bathrooms,"To all of you coming to college in the fall with the intention of living here, I’m sure you’re all excited. You get freedom, and a chance at adulthood. 

This summer, I’ve had the chance to have a trial college run in my new college based upon this state run program, courtesy of New Jersey. So far, I’ve learned how to make my bed, how to make a paper, and how to poop.

When you’re at home, you tend to poop freely. At school you tend to stop, because it’s disgusting and people tend to be dirty pigs. From experience, I never went in a public bathroom at school. I just used the English Department’s bathroom, because I was really close with them and the VP didn’t care if a student asked. But most of the time, I would only go in the morning, when I first woke up, and then once I got home at 5. But that was still bad. You might live at college from August to Thanksgiving. Or you might stay during the week and go home on the weekends on laundry. Regardless, that’s five days. You should get used to it. 

My first week at college was hard, and pun intended. But I found ways around it.

There’s some things you should do:

1. Poop alone. Sometimes you won’t feel as self conscious if you have an audience. You should try to go during times when not a lot of people have breaks, like at night when everybody is partying or during class times. Say everybody on your phone has an 8 AM class, go then. Put on music or a tv show if you have to, so you forget you’re not in a communal bathroom. Don’t worry. They get cleaned on the reg, and everybody understands to clean up after them self. Only, the ones in the classrooms might not, especially if you take summer courses where 100 kids out of a 2,000 school are taking classes. My school rented out space to a day camp with the YMCA, like the pool and a science lab, so the bathrooms in one building did look like toddlers had been through it. Don’t worry though, as they aren’t usually like that. There will be that occasional person who doesn’t flush, but it’s really far between.

2. Drink a lot of soda/Gatorade/energy drinks. I’m not joking. That’s how I got me to poop. Took me days to do. At the designated mealtimes, I would drink regular Pepsi (were a Pepsi school sorry) and then at night during study hall, run to poop. Just be warned, if you drink too much, it turns your poop moss green and stinky. Try a cup or two, not the entire bottle day after day. Also, soda at college is expensive. A bottle in the vending machine, for me, was two dollars, while it was free in the mess hall (and you get unlimited drinks) and one dollar at the Rite Aid by my house. Also, for girls, be warned that those girly things are expensive. It was two dollars for a regular tampon. Bring your own. Campus might seem like a bubble, especially in rural or suburban areas, but they have ways around it.

3. Poop when you have to. From experience, I can tell you that if you let it accumulate and just wait until class ends, you’ll end up taking fifteen minutes, sitting on the toilet, sweating and in pain. The reason? I always thought I would miss something so I would stay in class and wait until I got back to my dorm. While I still tend to do it, I try my hardest to stop.

4. Poop after you eat. While it might seem like you’re a bulimic, it works. At home, I would always poop after I had a big meal, as it emptied me out and made more room. College isn’t like high school: if you have to use the bathroom, just leave. Most professors don’t care if you’re out for 15 minutes, as it might be a hike (for me it was) or you might be constipated or whatnot. Just don’t miss the entire lesson. If you just had lunch and now have to take English 101, wait for the teacher to give directions and then go. Just, don’t miss the whole lesson, or don’t poop if it’s a difficult class, like a remedial math or a chemistry course for an English major. You could end up missing something important. I always try to go after I finish my work, like after a test.

5. Try to eat poop foods. In addition to soda, there’s other things you can try: oatmeal, beans, broccoli, nuts, berries, tacos, apples, popcorn. It might depend on your cafeteria though. My school is small, so we only have one, and it’s usually only a few foods. However, we are allowed to order out. Know that college towns tend to have a lot of foods, like Chipotle, Taco Bell, etc. many of which are rich in poop foods. 

6. Force yourself to poop. If all else fails, sit on the toilet and poop. I would only advise against it if you are in class, or if there’s a line in the bathroom. You’ll either miss work or you’ll make others miss it. 

Best of luck!",10,0,455.042015979944,college
Calc Teacher's Unfair Quizzes Jeopardize my Scholarship,"So on the first two quizzes in my Calculus 1 class, I got 65%. My current grade in the class is 26/40.

The issue isn't that I don't understand the topics he's teaching; it's that he throws quiz questions with subconcepts he never taught us.

Any way to get a single dorm room?,"I was just assigned my room for the upcoming semester, however I was assigned a double room. I went and saw them and even stayed in one for a night during orientation. I barely slept that night due to the dead silence of the room and how moving even the slightest in the bunk bed would potentially wake the other person up.

I’m also a night owl, and am usually up very late. No roommate is going to want to deal with me being up while they’re trying to sleep and nor do I want them to have to deal with me.

The room is small and I’m claustrophobic, and with 2 people in there I will absolutely lose it. I’m already dreading going to college and this will make it so many times more worse for me. I’m not going to be able to properly study or do work unless I’m alone. It’s how I’ve always done it. And if I can’t do my work properly, that’s an issue.

Medical wise, I have a weak immune system. So I’m usually not out around too many other people or I’m usually isolated because I’m very likely to get sick going out in public, and it’s not like I even gain any sort of immunity each time.

Single rooms are not exclusive to upperclassmen either. 

So is there any way I can try and talk to the residence services and possibly get a single room? Of course telling them I’ll have a near mental breakdown due to claustrophobia or something of the sort won’t cut it. Maybe if I talk with my doctor I could get a medical reason. Possibly something like a special circumstance like a social anxiety disorder (not sure if this would cut it either, but I’m almost 100% sure I have one even though it’s not diagnosed).

I’m literally having an anxiety attack now thinking about all this. It’s especially bad because it’s not like I’m far from home either. I’m actually within the commuting range limit, but the drive is still too much to do it daily. The feeling of being so close to being able to commute but not being able to taunts me.",12,0,100.80752523920326,college

*Serious* How do I get my sister into an Ivy League School?,"I'm a first generation college student currently at NYU.

Then they do something that makes them stand out like Intel Science Finalist or National Olympiad (or National something really), or even creating a non-profit. 

I don't even remember being able to volunteer anywhere until I turned 15, so I'm not sure how to get her involved in community service until then. 

Even as I'm writing this I feel bad because I remember the immense pressure and disappointment from those years- I love my college experience now, and realized that any college is how you make it. But I guess I feel sorry for my parents on one end because they want to feel pride- it's something about making those sacrifices of your immigrant parents worth it I guess. 

Any ideas where to start with ECs? Should I draw out a plan from beginning to end, and should she try to find something to do this summer? 

Furthermore, my little sister has an interest in STEM, and wants to explore various areas of engineering. I feel like a lot of people I go to college with actually had lab experience in high school- we're right down the road from our state university, but I'm truly wondering if any sane Principal Investigator or a PhD student would take their time out of the day for a mere 14-15 year old to train them in basic skills and eventually their own research project?

I'm not liking college.,"I really don't get my college sometimes... I understand math (took college algebra this summer and passed with an A+) took a wellness course just because I needed a total of 6 credit hours to use my financial aid... (again, passed with an A+) over an eight-week period. Yet I still get talked to like I'm some type of idiot because all my academic advisor looks at is my GPA from when I was doing Non Destructive Testing Courses (was 16 at the time) and I failed that one class, now my GPA, is like a... really low number... They talk to me like I’m stupid or something and it bothers me. 

Sigh, I'm good at teaching things to myself, yet I've noticed that NOO one will take that seriously (from my understanding.) I taught myself ""basic"" programing (just enough to build viruses for fun) I taught myself how to safely navigate the deep web and all that other fun stuff that comes along with computers and browsing… Oh, and this is unrelated but I taught myself Biology (and for all the wrong reasons too.) 

Right now I'm currently teaching myself Arabic and Bengali... So why is it my advisors treat me like I’m an idiot again? Oh. I forgot, it's because when I was 16 I failed Radiology 2 while going to high school full time, as well as taking (a little over 7 credit hours) at a community college (and not by choice either.) I don’t think college is for me, but I go any way. Any one else in the same boat?

The aspect of Citation that eludes me is this: why is it so damn important to get the exact order of day month year correct, or to use a semicolon vs. a period, or putting something in italics vs. underlining? Wouldn't it be enough to clearly state where the info came from, not excluding any info, but just not being a nazi about getting the formatting correct?

How To Get Off Your Dream College's Wait List,"Last week the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/education/on-the-waiting-list-some-college-applicants-try-a-little-dazzle.html?hp&_r=0) published an article discussing how some recent college-bound overachievers attempt to keep the attention of admissions board as the last open slots for the fall are offered and claimed.

Here are some tactics that absolutely **WON’T** help you secure one of those final seats at the college of your dreams:

* Sending admissions officers cookies, cupcakes, or anything unrelated to your scholastic interests.
* Having a parent obsessively email admissions officers.
Offering bribes of any kind (even really big ones).
* Claiming a school is your first choice, when it really isn’t.
* Writing non-specific notes about how you “love love love, OMG AM SO OBSESSED WITH” a school.
* Questioning a college’s judgement, or the quality of accepted students.
* Camping outside the admissions office in a tent.  Don’t take it from us, [listen to the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/education/on-the-waiting-list-some-college-applicants-try-a-little-dazzle.html?hp&_r=0).  (Have people actually done this?)

Do you know what **WILL** work?  Writing the school of your heartfelt desires a pointed and mature letter.  Detail your continued interests and update the admissions office on any new developments and accomplishments since your initial submission.  Admissions officers are still interested in why you would be a better fit for their institution than other candidates, and an appreciation of a school’s curriculum, faculty, school spirit and history all prove genuine interest versus arbitrary obsession.  One well-articulated note is worth 4,000 empty “I love yous,” so sit down and pour your passion onto the page.  Then click “send,” and cross your fingers.  Sincere expression works wonders, and luck often decides the rest.

How much of the material you learned in college did you use or have been using in your daily life as an everyday person?,"I'm upset with college because all throughout public education, i couldn't use what i learned in my daily life. Using it in your daily life retains that information so you don't forget in the future like how a lot of people do.

For example, if math is a universal language then why can't we use it in our daily life such as english? People often say that math is suppose to teach critical thinking and problem solving in which it does but if that was the only case then why don't they just call the class that? The problem is that the way they teach math is like a puzzle. It's pretty much mental masturbation, it has no practical purpose because they fail to teach how we can use it in our daily life so we don't forget it. If teachers only teach us the calculations like how they do in class, then we are no better than calculators, we are capable of understanding the purpose and history behind it which makes us different. The history is important because the history of mathematics and how it came into existence is what gives it its entertainment value which is important for memory purposes. Memorizing tasks is not nearly as easy to remember as a story. Without being taught the story, people often start to develop a lack of interest in the subject, therefore I think that might be one of the reasons for the lack of STEM majors in recent years.",16,0,1101.4435090354996,college

Group Work - How do I do the work without upsetting another member?,"(Convenient TLDR at the bottom.)

I hate group work, but I've always survived by volunteering to do it myself and allow the other members to piggyback on my grade with no slights on group member evaluations.

I'm not a flawless writer, but I've been a TA and writing fellow for science courses, taken courses specifically about writing in the sciences, and earned a 5.5/6.0 on my GRE analytical writing. It's also a sad truth that I would call only ~10% of the students I graded for ""good"" writers.

I graduated with a science degree and technical writing certificate, but have to take OChem this summer to get into my grad program. We have four people in our lab group and we must write a lab report for every experiment. The reports aren't long and I enjoy doing them, so I volunteered to do it and share it on Google Drive for them to suggest edits and give input. Only one other member has been giving input, and she's downright wrong in many things she's suggested so far.

Some were more a matter of writing style, and I made all those changes so that she could feel her input was heard, but beyond that she's placed punctuation in weird locations and said there were ""lots of run-on sentences"" in the original. There were none, she clearly believes that ""run-on sentences"" are simply long sentences, which they are not. I'm verbose, but my sentence structure is correct.

Today, as I was taking notes to prepare today's lab report, she asked me what I intended to do for various sections, and I told her. She suggested something that would be redundant and I said so, and she seemed upset and asked if I was just in charge of everything now. I told her I was not and that if she wished to write the lab reports she may, but I do insist that the bulk of the report be written by one person. I do not care who that one person is (a lie, I suspect other group members would do a bad job) but papers written piecemeal always have terrible flow problems. She didn't respond to that but seemed okay.

We will likely be working together for the next two months. The other two members seem fine with things the way they are, but she seems to want to take an active role in the lab reports. I don't want to shut her out, but I'm worried her edits will hurt the final product. What can I do?

**TL;DR**: I'm happy to do all the work for my group's lab reports. Another member seems upset she is not having a more active role in writing them, but the suggestions she *has* made indicate she would probably hurt rather than help. How do I work *with* her without a) upsetting her, b) steamrolling her suggestions, c) making her feel like I'm lecturing her on writing technique?",10,1,1223.1064141280922,college

I hate college (long and whiny),"I was pumped for college since before high school. Knew what I wanted to major in, had all these dreams of making friends and going out, all that jazz. Every year of school that dream got toned down -- I realized it would be a lot of work, most people don't make it, the school is huge, I'd still be in state -- but I still hoped for the best.

Now I'm here and it is hell. It takes me forever to learn everything and then I got a B on my Biology test and bombed my Chemistry test. I love my bioengineering class but I dropped Calculus because 17 hours was already too much and I just wasn't ready/wasn't getting it. Im in an honors english class but i hate it and can never think of anything to contribute and i used to love english. Now I'm changing my major, and to be totally honest nothing interests me at all. There's nothing I want to major in and there's nothing I want to do with my life.

My roommate is my best friend from high school but she's probably actually slept here 3 times since school started and I see her for an hour a day (she left yesterday afternoon and will be gone until Sunday). Besides her and my long distance best friend/boyfriend/idk I have no friends. I went to clubs and either didn't like the people, the club was related to the major I'm dropping, or have time constraints.

the course load is nothing right now yet I feel like I'm drowning. I never go to bed before 1, I feel like I'm constantly trying to reach this place of caught up/done and I never get there. 

the worst part is that I went to a really, really good school that promised to make college cake. there are people going to Yale and Harvard from there who are breezing through their classes. There are people here from that school doing well. 

I just can't do it. I can't get the material fast enough, I don't have the discipline to do what I need to, I don't have any passion, and I'm just miserable all the time.

Unfair grades? Should I get used to them?,"Well I just attended my first few classes at a community college. I dropped a few but the ones I kept were:

* basic English

* an ""introductory"" slash study prep (aka social free time class where we just goofed off)

* A Drawing class. 

I got nothing but Bs in all of them.

My art class was the class that took the last straw for me. In my art class my teacher was pregnant to begin with.  She was due soon and did have her child during our semester. We got another teacher to replace her who was much less forgiving in work. After the 9 or so weeks the original teacher came back and joined the substitute  teacher for final grading.

She is back for this one day to judge the work in our portfolio that we filled during the semester (during her absence). She was barely there long enough to ""know"" our work but I felt she did have a slight idea as to who were committed and who were not.. I don't know that is what I felt anyway.

Regardless, I do not think it is fair for a teacher who is barely there to be able to grade our entire portfolio in one day and have it be our final grade.  She doesn't know the context of the work environment, the students or even anything really. I ended up getting another B for whatever reason. I was one of the 10 (out of nearly 30) that stuck all the way through and barely missed a class.  Some of these assignments required us to actually go to SEVERAL locations and draw what we saw. Some students got to do the work at home opposed to in class.. etc 

Like I said at this school I am getting nothing but Bs. I've had issues here before and filing complaints get you know where.  It was never for anything academic though. 

Is this common in college? Is it common to get teachers who leave and come back like that? Is it common to get all Bs in one semester? It just seems fishy to me and I will be transferring but I just don't want to get my hopes up again in hopes of change if t his is actually common.

I only took 3 classes and my GPA now is a 3.1 is that good?  I took one class at another school that was college credit and I was able to get an A there but not here.

Boyfriend not allowed to ride public bus with me because didn’t have his school ID - that he doesn’t get until his first day tomorrow,"My boyfriend is already nervous enough to begin with, as most people are the day before they start over as a freshman in college. But we wanted to make the most of it, and take a trip to the mall. We aren’t the richest but we go out a lot, so it’s mostly public transportation for us. 

He has a student bus pass supplied by his college and I have a 30-day unlimited bus ride card. Lately, going places hasn’t been too big of a deal because they just scan his card and we get on. But today was ironically the day where something went wrong?? It says on the card that you need a student ID present to use your bus card, and usually bus drivers can pick apart in their head that “hey, this is a young ish looking boy with nice clothes and a polite attitude, he is most likely actually starting college and didn’t steal this bus card”, and they don’t ask for his ID and he doesn’t mind because he wont get it til his first day.

We had gone to the mall a town over on the bus without an issue as we had done literally dozens of times before and today, we needed to get home because we are both tired and the bus driver sees his bus card and says “Give me your student ID” and my boyfriend kind of just goes “uhhh” at a loss and I pitch in and say, “Hey, tomorrow is his first day and he’ll have his ID tomorrow” and the bus driver says “ I don’t care, either get off or pay like everyone else.” 

Is this bus driver just rude or are we in the wrong for being unprepared? My bf was really upset afterwards and said “I’m pretty sure the cost of my tuition is a little more than the $1.75 everyone pays but ok” and we had to get a lyft home much to his distaste because we had absolutely no way to break change for another bus. I feel really bad because I know he didn’t want to spend that extra money but I just wanted to share this and ask if anyone else has ever gone through something similar??

Douche bag professor,"So, just to preface, I am a senior and I’ve been in school for five years because of major changes. In that amount of time I have never had a problem with a professor. I’ve never had any problems with grades. I usually know what I deserve and if I get a crappy grade then I typically know I didn’t do my best work and take it because I feel it’s fair.

However, this semester is different. From the start, I could tell I would have a difficult time in this class because of this guy. Basically he is a nazi about participation, which is fine but I don’t necessarily like it. I didn’t show up to class once and he marked me -4 points because I didn’t tell him. Fine, that was my mistake. I wasn’t prepared for one class because I misread the announcement and he marked me -8. How in the hell is coming to class just not having read something negative more points than actually missing class?!

Anyways, he sent out where our participation was for the semester thus far and mine is incredibly low. Other than one class missed, I have been early for class and stayed the entire time and made sure to comment and stay attentive and off my phone every single time. I have also been prepared for class every single time besides the one mix up that I had.

I basically told him how frustrated I was with the set up of his class and how I didn’t deserve a -8 for being unprepared. He got super defensive and basically told me I have a month to be better.

I found out my friend, who happens to be Asian, had received almost 100% participation when she is always late, on her phone and leaving early. I literally blew up and sent him another email about how he is biased and completely inconsistent with his grading. I haven’t heard back but I’m sure it will be another email of him being defensive.

Please tell me my anger is justified. And who can I go to to make a complaint? I’m worried that because I called him out on his crappy class structure that he will grade me low. Is there something the school can do to protect students from something like that?



Edit: I should have added why I even mentioned my friend was Asian. I just added it because there are other students in the class who have done way better than her with participation and got a lower grade so whether or not it is a race thing it is at least favoritism.

And for the assholes who are just assuming I’m a lazy worthless student, you clearly are not adults with obligations outside of school. Sometimes people mix things up. Sometimes you have to miss class. I have consistently shown that I am a good student who puts the work in. So fuck you too.",13,0,99.95911088735141,college

Roommates,"Hello I went off on spring break around a week or two ago and am almost certain that I left my pair of apple headphones in my room (the ones that come with the X).

Convince me I need college.,"I've completed two years at the community college and am about to transfer to a University of California. I'm trying to get things sorted but it's a hot mess. The UC did not prep for transfer students, so I got the crumbs when it came to class choices, so my schedule makes it very hard to do any work to make money. I haven't even moved in but my landlord is already being sketchy and the area is not the best too.

I currently run my own business. When I had to push pretty hard, I made $4k in a month. Without trying, I can usually make 1.8-2.2k. In the background, I've been working on an affiliate marketing campaign building a brand that I'll soon be filtering traffic through. I feel I have all these things going for me, I don't know why I'm going through all these hoops just to set myself into what feels like an awful situation (landlord changing conditions, fighting schedule issues, burying myself in debt.)

How to Be Popular in College,"I feel like I just let people walk all over me so that they can accept me.

Sometimes I do things people say because I think it will make them like me more, but then I just feel pathetic afterward. I think the internet is making people more asocial, and that's why no one likes me. I don't know, I'm just trying not to have peaked in high school, but I have not been very successful.

I graduated college on the East Coast (USA) some time back and occasionally reminisce on my “good old days.” One aspect I can’t forget are the things I personally witnessed the dining hall staff get away with:

1) Laziness. Milk, salad dressing, etc. ran out a long time ago while they’re huddled in the back kitchen talking and laughing.

2) Snippy demeanors at all times. I once asked an employee to restock the milk machine and before I could finish my sentence, I noticed eye rolling and agitation. I thought about calling her out on this, but decided it wasn’t worth an argument and a lawsuit.*

3) Health code violations. Both my friend and I found hair each of our dishes one evening. On another occasion I was eating lunch when a cleaning lady picked my plate up with her dirty, gloved hand while I was eating and proceeded to wipe the table down.

I intentionally failed out of school. How do I explain it in my readmission letter?,"It's a little difficult to phrase this question, but I'll try my best.

&nbsp;


Nearing the end of high school, mental health issues influenced a large part of my personality, consequently precluding me from any conviction that might've helped me see the value in a college education. Just having enough intelligence from having been exposed to competitive debate, classical music competitions, computer programming, and higher-level classes, I somehow convinced myself that educational institutions were not meant for ""a genius like me"", leaving me to perceive those around me as ""complacent"" and ""unimaginative"". I dually believed *against* and *for* movies like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""The Social Network"", ***against*** other students who were more skilled in those respective areas than me, developing an inferiority complex like no other, and ***for*** myself, finding any existent nuance in my decent mathematical or programming ability as evidence of my ""similar genius"".

&nbsp;

Although my poor performance near the end of senior year should have been evidence enough for me to tone down this narcissism, the fact of my hospitalization allowed me to attribute some of this performance elsewhere. I barely made it out of high school and was accepted into the Spring Semester at a nicely-ranked university. Even this had put a damage to my psyche. Should I attend a nicely-ranked school one semester later than most of my peers, or should I attend a decently-ranked local school? I ended up choosing the former, and in order to save some semblance of a reputation I had, I attended a community college for the fall semester. Even there, I overestimated my ability as a responsible student and decided to postpone homework and walk in cold to exams because, after all, ""I'm a genius right?""

&nbsp;

Moving into the Spring semester was especially difficult since I hadn't had any friends at this out-of-state school from the previous semester, compounded by the fact that I was put into the Honors dormitory, clearly comparing myself with people who actually didn't need to study to do well. I felt that I had to prove my ""genius"" ability as a mathematician and a programmer, and started living a complete lie. I had not placed out of any classes except calculus, however, the supposed embarrassment of starting a first semester CS course after most of the freshman had already finished it drove me to lie that I was in fact taking senior-level courses, while skipping my actual classes, as to avoid being spotted by any classmates. I ended up doing this for all of my classes, getting trapped in the domino effect of rearranging my schedule.

&nbsp;

The only possible way out of this, I thought, was to go on and actually teach myself everything from these classes. At first, this seemed reasonable, but the constant flight and tension from possibly being unearthed by my parents or peers became the largest focus of my activities. I became just good enough at programming to receive internships and job offers, while learning just enough knowledge of my other subjects to carry on higher-level conversations and debates on those subjects.

&nbsp;

Nearing the end of the following fall semester, I had been following the same practice, but this time knew that I would be dismissed if I didn't start attending classes. I decided to phrase my dismissal as a drop-out, and moved to Silicon Valley, where I began working for a start-up. After all, if I'm such a ""genius"", all I need is the magical opportunity of the entrepreneur right? Well five months in, I've been ""let go"" from that opportunity, leaving me to seek job opportunities while staying at what is essentially a home retrofitted with 20+ bunk-beds.

&nbsp;

""Fortunately"", over the past year, I've come to realize that what I've needed is humility, humility to admit the truth before it explodes like a ball of fire, while being able to shut out my peers from creating any unhealthy comparisons. I've also developed a real work ethic, allowing me to acknowledge my limitations, as well as leaving room for a little grandeur now and then. However, what's helped me more than anything else has been to believe that I nor anybody else is a ""genius"". This device has allowed me to keep my reality in check.

"Professor tried to get my lab partner and I kicked out of our program for ""cheating.""","**TL;DR:** Lab partner and I collected our data and printed it out. Partner accidentally only printed one copy and xerox the data for my lab report. We got called out for cheating and threatened to get kicked out of the engineering program... Even though the data was made by both of us and it wouldn't have been a big deal if we printed two copies rather than just one and xerox scanning the other.

Prepare for wall of text:

My lab partner and I were taking a electrical engineering class. The reports were written individually, but you write down who your partner is anyways. At the end of the report, you're supposed to include your screenshot of a graph that comes out of an oscilloscope. My lab partner printed the screenshot for us. He accidentally printed only one, and rather than going back to click print again, he just grabbed the paper and xerox copied one for me. The xerox copy came out looking kind of like a xerox. We turned our lab reports in.

The following week, I we both got e-mails from our professor threatening to get us expelled and he has assigned us both an F in the class. We go confront him about why he thought we were cheating. He said that we copied each others work. This guy was super heated and red.

We both explain that we are lab partners and the screenshot was both of our work. We ask him to check attendance and see we sat at the same table together and did the work together as instructed in our manual. The TA running the lab can back us up also. We even had the file on a USB to show him. This all made the professor even more mad. He doubled down and told us ""cheating is cheating and you both will have to deal with the consequences!""

At this point, my lab partner and I knew that there was no reasoning with the professor. We had to take blame and be at his mercy. This guy had our futures in his hands. My lab partner stepped forward, told the professor he made the mistake and to give him the F and he'll retake the class. I stepped forward and said we'll take an F rather than risk being expelled from the engineering program.

The professor ended up telling us that we should learn from what we have done and he'd let us go with a warning.

Years have gone by and I've learned a lot about people. I believe he didn't see that we were lab partners on our cover sheets, sent an angry e-mail and it was too late. Rather than seeing that we were innocent, he already acted in the heat of the moment and decided to double down on it.

EDIT: What I learned from this scenario. The professor was already angry. Trying to prove our innocence to him made things worse. It sucks, but we weren't in a good position to bargain anything. The best thing we could have done was ask him kindly if he would hear us out before he came to any conclusions. This might have calmed him down a little bit, or it might not have. 

Reading people and trying to predict their actions is important. You can learn a lot in college, but some of the most important lessons are your interactions with the 1000s of people you come across campus. Learn about reading body language and tones. This is something college doesn't teach you in a book but rather indirectly.",0,0,49.37552292438845,college
Bullying situation in college upset me years later.,"There's a friend that I have been close with, ever since college. Six years ago, when I was getting ready to graduated, the campus was having an event outside. And I was eating food at the event with others. Suddenly, my friend comes to me upset.

Somehow, the bully incident gets brought up, and I'm mad about it again. I haven't thought about it in a long time, but hearing about it again has set me off and kind of agitated me. It put me in an ""I only wish I had been there mindset"". This was six years ago. Not sure the incident being brought up again would upset me.

"College has F*CKED me, advice needed.","Hello my dear rutabagas, 

Let me just start by saying how screwed our higher education system is, and how every slave working for them seems to not care one bit. I have yet to find someone at my college to give me actual helpful advice....

I go to a private college for my bachelors of science in nursing. I am also a non-traditional student being that I am now 26 years of age. Last Fall I regrettably failed a course (by 2%, needed an overall 80% in class to pass). When I knew that there was a chance I may not pass the course I went to the professor who happens to be the head of the department, and a real piece of work at that (meaning she loves to see students fail, it is what brings her life). I wanted to see if it was possible to take the course again during the winterim so I wouldn't fall behind, and she said that they didn't offer the course in winter. She told me she planned on doing a hybrid course in the Spring semester that you could do with the other courses since so many students weren't going to pass. But then, of course, has to add in that if you couldn't pass the normal course that the chances of passing the hybrid course were extremely slim and that you should just retake the normal course. Why even offer that course then?! It was only designed for students who weren't going to pass anyways....

I then scheduled a meeting with my Faculty Advisor, who gave me the same spheal. She told me to look into other colleges that offer the course over winterim and to take it there if possible. She had no list of schools and no other helpful advice/options. She did tell me she would let me know of any changes or other opportunities though.

So since all my professors and advisors recommended to retake the normal course, I decided to do that. It would set me back a semester because that one class is the gate-way to all the others (such as my clinical at a hospital). I am coming to terms with this during my winter break when 2 weeks away from the start of the spring semester I find out that they did last-minute offer a winter course of the class I failed! It was so last minute only a handful of students found out about it and got to take it making them not pushed back a semester because of one course. I was angry in the moment and found many other students who felt the same way in my exact position. We pay so much money to go to this school that we should be given all the same opportunities. Why was a mass email not sent out to all students whether you passed or failed??

We all talked about going to the head of the nursing department and the Dean of the school, but once the semester started I was fully occupied. I retook the damn normal course and passed with a 92% (I also had a completely different instructor, night and day I tell ya..).

Well now the real kicker is that I just found out I don't have enough financial aid to pay for school after this year because I hit my limit. All the financial aid office at my school keeps telling me to do is to take out private loans. It is like pulling teeth to get some sort of help of other avenues I can take. 

If I would have known about that winterim class I wouldn't have to worry about a whole other semester of school I have to pay for. I feel cheated and need advice on what I should do. Is it worth it to write a letter about this to the Dean? I still have messages from students who felt betrayed like me... I know schools are businesses but this has really f\*cked me over.

&#x200B;

 **tl;dr**: Needed to retake a class, asked of options from the professor and my advisor about if there was a winter course, etc that I could take. They said our college doesn't offer that. Low and behold they ended up last minute offering said course but failed to make this information known to a lot of students. Now I am a semester behind because of this one course, and I don't have enough financial aid to cover me for that semester. Is it worth writing a letter to the Dean? What are my options? All advice welcome!

"I'm going to fail half of my classes, what's going to happen to me?","Right, to start. I'm a freshman at a California State University, trying to major in Computer Engineering. My first issue is that I am garbage at calculus 2 and the teacher I have determined and verified among other students and RateMyProfessor is absolute garbage. I am failing that course with a 66% and I have very low hopes I will be capable of raising it with the final coming 5 days from now. My second issue is that I'm perfectly good with Electrical Engineering as confirmed by the A I currently have in EECE 144. However with the second EECE course I am taking I got the major supplies and parts for the class mid-semester, and was not able to catch up on the graded homework involving the supplies. In addition to this, much like the calculus teacher I have determined and verified among the other students and RateMyProfessor that this teacher is equally not as great. I am failing this class with a 60% and have the final tomorrow. I have a 2.7 GPA and am existing on loan. As mentioned in the title, I'm currently taking 4 classes for a total of 15 units.

&#x200B;

The first question I have is, what the hell?! How is it that so many students here, at the very college I go to can party, get hammered and stoned off their rockers, and still be in better shape than me? My roomate is a party hard kind of guy where I'm just the quiet nerd that likes to sit in a corner and program all day. He's acing his classes and not having any problems whatsoever. What's he doing that's so different? How am I not capable of managing my work load, avoiding situations where I only get the tools to participate in the class midway through the semster, enjoying some semblance of a social life, and maintaining the proper health and diet? What am I doing wrong that literally every-fucking-one else has figured out to the point that they can go party on weekends.

&#x200B;

Next question, I don't know what I'm going to do from here. With a 2.7 GPA 2 F's are really going to dent that. Am I going to lose my loans? Get kicked out? Be forced to take another semester? What are my options here and how can I recover. I want to graduate 3 years from now and I feel like I'm not at all on track.

advice for friend's daughter going into college,"sorry this might be jumbled.

My friend's daughter is a senior in high school and is applying to colleges narrowing down her choices. she's pretty busy, with a 3.8gpa and about like 6 extracurricular activities. she's done her fafsa already. she doesn't know what she wants to major in but she's really great in math. that may change. she has a few scholarships lined up too!

she also has really bad anxiety about not finishing school in 4 years and she doesn't want to take any breaks if she doesn't have enough money. she's afraid if she takes a break she won't ever go back.

she stresses out about things like ""how do i carry heavy books when I can't use pdfs"" she also won't be choosing to live on campus. she made a chart of her expenses if she did live on campus. and she prob won't drive. she wants to know how to carry her books if she wants to study after class on campus. she will be about a 15 minute walk to her campus if she gets picked for the one she wants. currently in hs she has to carry her schoolbooks too like 3 textbooks and she complains a lot. i told her to leave it in the principals office and grab it when she has that class but she never took that advice i guess.

She's a little disorganized. As in I think if her classes are all over the place and there are big time blocks she doesn't know what to do. she's afraid she will fall asleep in the library or space out the whole time until her next class.

she is also thinking about tutoring part time to make some money but now she's doubting if this will be even feasible for her. she feels she might not have enough time.

i told her to go to office hours since it is important. i did that a lot when i was in college. but she is very shy and bashful so i hope she takes advantage of this.

Should I switch rooms or stick with my weird roommate?,"Hey everyone!

I've been stressing over this decision for the past few days. So I got my roommate for residence and right away I realized we wouldn't be a good fit. I'm very social and outgoing and love parties. This person is very shy and quiet. While I wouldn't have a problem with my roommate not wanting to party, she just gives me a very weird vibe. I won't get into details, but she has really strange posts on her instagram and facebook accounts. She's very religious and certain things she's said to me have rubbed me the wrong way. Keep in mind that we have not moved in together yet.

I emailed my university about my concerns and they said they could switch me into a different room. The only issue is that this room is in a different residence, called the Thompson residence. The residence that I've gotten assigned to is attached to all the other residences so I've heard it's very good socially and for parties. However, the residence I could switch into is not attached to the resident complex. I have heard they do throw parties and are social, but because of the fact they are seperate from the other residences, it's harder to attend all the res parties.

I also face the issue of not knowing who I'm going to be paired with in the Thompson residence, so it could be with somebody equally as bad. However, I do have a friend in the Thompson residence who has said we could switch and become roommates if we both aren't vibing with our roommates.

I really don't know what to do. I know it might seem like a silly thing, but I really want to have the best university experience possible. I really don't want to room with this person, and our dorms aren't nice and private. We're going to be right next to eachother in the same room, and she makes me uncomfortable. I didn't have the best high school experience, so I want to meet more people and expand my social circle even more.

Spread the Message!!,"I am trying to put together a grassroots Twitter campaign to have Congress raise the amount of money that employers may provide to working students tax-free.  This is known as the exclusion amount; it is currently $5,250 and has not been raised since 1986!!  If you adjust this for inflation the amount would be almost $12,000.  I am proposing that Congress increase the amount immediately to $12,000 and adjust it for inflation yearly.

When the limit was last raised in 1986, this was enough to pay for a full year of tuition at an average 4-year college.  Inflation and the rise of tuition have eroded this value significantly.

The cool part of this plan is that it would help reduce the amount of student loans because employers could encourage students to use their programs.  It would also help shift debt off of the Federal Government's balance sheet, and onto those of private businesses.

Experiences of college cheating?,"Either yourself, your friends, someone you know, or even any other circumstance where you could clearly see that a fellow student, whom you might not even know, was cheating on an exam? I'll tell you one particularly brazen incident that happened during my sophomore year.

I was taking an Intermediate Calculus class. Because most people do not really do anything beyond Introductory Calc unless they are math, physics, or engineering majors and it is required for their program, the class was quite small, maybe 40 people tops. It was the end of the semester and now it was time to write the final.

The midterm exam came in an envelope that we had to open at the start of the exam to retrieve the exam papers. I think this was done to ensure that nobody started the exam early until the supervisor gave the signal to start. The same practice was applied to the final, and one student clearly took advantage of that.

There was a girl in the class whom I had never really noticed before, but she was clearly in the class as she was writing the exam with the rest of the students. Idk, perhaps she had not been coming to most of the lectures or maybe I just didn't notice her, but either way she was sitting right in front of me and less than five minutes into the test I noticed something very peculiar.

Of course, the instructor had told us that we were free to write down notes and formulas *after* the start of the exam if we didn't want to forget anything, but of course we couldn't bring anything in that had information before the exam had started. When I momentarily looked in front of me as I was trying to just look over the entire test and compose myself before answering the first question, I caught a glimpse of her envelope and it was filled with writing.

At that point, I instantly knew something was off. The entire envelope was covered in notes and they seemed to be very neatly written, definitely not something that you could write in five minutes. Just to make it clear, I was sitting too far away to discern the writing, but I could clearly see that it was there, and there was quite a lot of it indeed. I decided to take another look at the envelope from an angle, and it was then that I could see that there was another envelope directly underneath it. Same dimensions, same generic brown color placed neatly under the first envelope so nobody would notice a thing. She had evidently brought a second envelope into the exam room, with the notes and formulae already written beforehand.

I wondered what to do at that point. It was the start of the test, and I was pretty sure I would be the only one to notice the cheating. I considered reporting her, but I did not want to look like a jerk and be ""that guy"" who reported her in front of the entire class. I also didn't want her to make a scene by arguing or crying as the professor was taking her exam away, as I was worried how this might affect my own mental clarity during the exam I had barely begun. I knew for a fact that there was no ""honor code"" at my school, so you could not get in trouble for simply not reporting the cheating, as long as you weren't letting them cheat off you, which I obviously wasn't so I just decided to continue my own exam and let the issue slide.

However, in retrospect there were and are a few things that really didn't sit well with me about this incident. It wasn't just the cheating itself, but also the brazenness of the cheating and the level of deception involved. When it comes to most instances of exam cheating, there is always a level of stealth involved, with a genuine fear that the professor may find out. There is always an attempt to hide the action of cheating and the materials used to commit that action when the cheating student sneaks glances at their friend's paper, opens up the crinkled cheat note that they had hidden in their sleeve, or goes to the washroom to look up some key piece of data on their smartphone. But here, the situation was different as the girl took deception to a whole new level. For her, it didn't matter if the professor or the other students saw the envelope, because she *knew* that they would simply think those were notes that she had written down *after* the exam had begun, which was perfectly acceptable. She *knew* she had an almost 100% chance of getting away with it, and was perfectly confident having the cheat envelope in plain view for all to see because she *knew* that they would be tricked into thinking those were just reminders she had written down *during* the exam. Instead of designing such elaborate cheating methods, wouldn't it have been easier to actually come to the lectures, do the recommended homework assignments and study? That's what everybody else did. Plus, I'm pretty sure I was the only one there who had any chance of catching her cheating because no other student would likely be in a position to see the second envelope neatly hidden away under the first one, and even I, if I had not noticed the writing on the envelope right at the start, would not have suspected anything.

I don't really have any hard feelings anymore given that it's been three years now, but I still wanted to share this here because it's an interesting story and really shows just what lengths some students will go to to get away with cheating, rather than actually taking the time to learn the material.",11,1,646.8662636651292,college

Stoners on here that live in dorms please read.,"Hello everyone! So I am a freshman stoner who smokes heavy. I have a 3.6, am pretty well rounded, in some clubs, and I do a lot more than just weed. That’s besides that point but I’m here to tell all of you that if you have ever been caught in your dorm with weed your probably a dumb ass(unless someone narced) and how to avoid it. I’m posting this because my roommate in the other room of our quad pretty much hotboxed his room with a joint and ruined it for me. Luckily they didn’t find anything cause I’m smart but onto why I’m really here. It’s not hard guys just follow these pretty simple rules 

1. Always have door shut, window open, and blanket/sheet at bottom of your door. These 3 little things can save u so much trouble it’s crazy.

2. Smoke average amounts at a time and try your hardest to get smoke out of the window. Holding your smoke in lets you have more control of where it goes. 

3. ☠️THIS IS MY BIGGEST RULE!: DO NOT SMOKE BLUNTS OR JOINTS IN YOUR ROOM IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH GETTING CAUGHT!!!☠️. This seems to be a trend where I go, blunts especially are just stupid to smoke in your room. 

4. Have some kind of smell producing item on deck. This could be a candle, any kind of cologne or body spray, I myself make coffee or tea most of the time cause it smells up the room lol. Even baby powder to put on some kind of cloth material.

5. This is my second biggest rule and you’d be surprised how many people don’t follow it. Never ever leave your bud stuff out in the  open. Whether it be glass, actual weed, a grinder, or even a lighter. I’ve met so many people who have been caught for this reason and it’s so easy to follow.

I write these rules not to make anyone who has been caught to feel dumb but to prevent it. If you have any others to add feel free to comment ! I would appreciate anything I didn’t cover.

Taking 2 weeks off of school: bad idea or no?,"I really don't want to go back to school this semester.

The two weeks is because I had planned on going to burning man (yes the actual event is only about a week but I will  actually be working it and making a generous amount of money) 

I'll only be taking intermediate Spanish, math, and bio 2. The only class I worry about falling behind on is math because I catch on to Spanish easily and I will be retaking bio 2 (I did really well in that class until about the 2 month mark due to outside circumstances). 

It just really sucks because I don't think I can convince my dad to let me take off an entire semester to the point where he will believe me and the fact that I'm not just going to drop out of school altogether and this would be taking place the start of the second week of school.

Can you guys comment on my Safety and Match Schools,"Hey everyone
I'm new here and am relatively unfamiliar with the criteria needed for a Safety and Match School. 

I'm a Chinese, Male, Junior currently attending Northville High School in Michigan... I want to work in finance when I'm older, so I am looking to attend either a highly ranked business school or a top school with a strong economics program. My Stats are:

35 ACT (12 writing)
3.93 Weighted GPA (Should go up to a 4.03 or so after this semester)
3.73 UW GPA... Side Note: My GPA is relatively low because of my bad freshman year. I received two 3.5's; my sophomore year I got a 4.1 and a 4.0, and my Junior year so far I got a 4.5. To emphasize this, my UC GPA (Capped) is a 4.23
My extracurriculars include working two jobs, as well as founding a club, and participating in varsity tennis for four years. I am also part of DECA, Science Olympiad, etc. and have over 150 hours of community service.

So here's my question. I am currently in the process of creating a college list, and am unsure of what to consider safeties and matches. Currently, my safeties are

Miami (OH) -- Farmer School of Business, and
Indiana Bloomington -- Kelley School of Business
I'm not sure if these should be considered safeties or matches??
My Matches:
UMICH (Pre-admit Ross),
UVA,
UNC, and
UCLA.
In my opinion, these all seem like high matches or maybe even reaches, so I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for match/safety schools with my credentials?
Much appreciated",8,0,920.3565414555785,college
Math professor is making little political jabs during lectures. Should I warn him that it could be risky?,"My mathematics professor has very liberal political views, and will make ~2-3 jokes aimed at right wing politics and the right wing parties (both Australian and the US). I don't take any offence at it myself, and I don't know of any right-leaning students in the class (I don't know everyone though), but I'm worried that someone *might* take great offence at his comments and cause trouble for him. Given the polarizing nature of the recent elections and the odd 'complaint-happy' nature of some of the younger students this year in particular, it could backfire on him in ways that it never has before. 

I consider us to be on pretty friendly terms since he's the supervisor for my SO, and we semi-regularly attend dinners and events with him and his wife. So it isn't like I'm just a random undergrad telling him what to do. Even if someone did take offence, I doubt it would ever negatively impact his career, but it'd certainly waste his time and cause him stress/trouble. 

Should I casually bring up the issue with him, as friendly concern? I quite like the jokes, but they're not worth him getting burned over.",6,0,943.8841803444674,college

[Advice] Are you thinking about leaving education after high school to put it off till later? I suggest reconsidering after doing so myself.,"If you're in a financially stable position that would enable you to get college courses completed without working at the same time I highly suggest taking the harder science courses asap while pacing yourself. Many people are not given such a fine opportunity to focus.

There are 5 math courses (1 algebra, 1 trigonometry/precalculus, 3 calculus), 5 chemistry courses, 2 biology courses,3 computer courses, and 3 physics courses that are incredibly fundamentally relevant to understanding the natural world and society around you. Many of these courses must be taken in a linear manner and are prerequisites for each other, particularly the 5 chemistry & 5 math courses.

You do not want to take these courses all at once. I suggest taking 2 at a time so you can really focus on them and digest them and build solid notes that you can draw from later. Most people never take these courses and never develop a mature understanding of their environment. 

This may very well take 3 to 5 years for the average person who hasn't gotten a head start on these courses in high school.

Be picky about your teachers. Their abilities and perspectives mean everything to developing insight and appreciation for the material, which is incredibly important. Be prepared to fight for a perfect GPA (4.0) if you want to maximize financial and lifestyle choices in your future. If you appreciate being able to choose for yourself, always shoot high in case you fall lower. 

You may very well fail some of these courses the first round and need to take them again. Be careful of class drop dates; care about your record. Counselors are often useless, yet you should still consider their advice every semester.

Remember, if you're taking easy courses in college, you're wasting your time, unless you're getting ready to take these harder courses and want to ease in, which is what I needed to do after the high school factory environment. 

College is building a foundation for the rest of your life. Do not let this period be unfruitful. Spend time thinking about practical positions you would enjoy fulfilling in the private sector. 

You have the chance to be both actually and financially independent if you make the right decisions now. 

If you have troubles living with your family, I understand how you might want to leave immediately. There is often significant financial aid available via your FAFSA (federal financial aid) that may pay several thousand a year in cash. Consider vandwelling while living off this sum and you may wind up with a very, very nice van. (/r/vandwellers). You are limited to the amount of courses you may be paid for via the FAFSA. **Courses that you take *without receiving financial* aid count against your FAFSA course unit maximum.**

Should I take a year off to feel more in control with my own life?,"Hey guys, I feel very conflicted right now as I don't feel certain about going to university this September anymore. 

I initially planned to take out an educational loan to go to a UK university to get my engineering degree. Although the interest rate is only 3% per year, I need $120,000 to cover everything from food to tuition fees. There's a possibility of it turning into a full ride scholarship if I get good results. However, what if I can't cope in such a different environment? What if I don't like the uni I'm attending? And what with Brexit and them trying to decrease immigration, I feel like I'm throwing my non-existent money away before I get to even keep it.

The thought of taking a year off and using that time to get a driving licence plus a job seems so much more attractive now. I just don't feel ready to fly to the UK and start university yet. It feels so rushed and impulsive. It's like I'm just going along with my friends' decision and not my own. And I don't feel in control at all.

So I was just notified of my academic dismissal... please help,"Today I received notice of my dismissal.  I just finished my junior year of college.  I did the first 3 semesters at a community college and transferred to a campus of my state university.  My transfer Gpa was 3.6 or so, all As and Bs, and I made the deans list my 2nd and 3rd semesters there.  My first semester at university I maintained that Gpa, and even made the deans list.

This fall semester I had a poor term gpa, of 1.7.  I ended with an A (.5 credit), a B (3 credits), a C (3 credits), a C (4 credits), an F (3 credits) and an F (.5 credits), the last of which was because I didn't realize I had accidentally registered for the 2nd part of a 2 part PE course until after the deadline for a W.  I was not put under any probation (my cum. Gpa was still above 2.0), and was presumably under good standing at this point.

This last semester I took 15 credits (5 classes) and received an F in every one, with a term gpa of 0 which dropped my cum. Gpa to 1.766, under the 2.0 limit for dismissal.

The reason for this was twofold.  First, anxiety/depression.  Basically, my life-plan was to get an education degree and become a teacher.  During our 60 hour field experience this semester (my first semester taking education classes), it slowly became clear to me that teaching was not a good fit for me.  I began having anxiety about going to the field days, so I didn't go.  That gave me anxiety about going to another class that had the same professor.  Then anxiety for my 3rd education class because it was with the same students in all 3 classes.  Around this time my anxiety started fueling depression, which brought back insomnia related sleeping issues, which led to not sleeping for 48 hours, then crashing during the day and being unable to go to my other 2 classes.  Basically from late March to mid may, I didn't go to a single class.

I don't have insurance and I can't afford a psychiatrist or dr to help prescribe anything.  However I did not use our schools free clinic either, which does offer counseling.  The last time I had this same issue was my senior year of high school - I had too many truancies so they forced me to graduate a quarter early.  I may have some documentation for seeing a dr for this reason at this time.

Basically, what I would *like* to do is change my major from History Ed. to History.  I would like to appeal (appeals are due early june, I'm not sure if an in person appeal is an option) and return to university this fall.  I need to take a course this summer anyway (**which would replace one of my Fs.  The other F I have to replace I was going to take next fall semester**) but would be unable to afford more than 1, though I could possibly afford 2 if I put them on my credit card.  What do you think my chances are?  What strategy should I use for my appeal?

One thing that is frustrating to me is that my cum. Gpa apparently doesn't include my transferred classes, even though I know they transferred in as grades (A/B etc) not just pass/fail.  **My current combined Gpa (as shown on my official university Advisement Report) is 2.642, well above the minimum.**

It is possible that I could obtain some sort of letters of recommendation if that would help.  My academic advisor and I talked about these anxiety/sleep issues in the fall semester while I had a class with him, though of course it wasn't as severe as this past semester.  It's also possible I could get a letter from my high school principal, whom I convinced to let me walk at graduation a few weeks after graduating early, explaining to her my anxiety/sleep situation.  Several high school teachers as well, and perhaps another college professor or 2.

So basically I'm feeling mostly numb right now.  It's 230am and I can't sleep, and I'm trying to keep away an anxiety attack.  Please tell me what I should do.",3,0,1242.8346664555784,college

How is Greek life at your school?,"Basically, I am a non-Greek freshman. A frat hasn't really been something I've been interested in, as before I went to college, I'd never met people who were in frats/sororities and enjoyed it. 

However, I am a very social person, and it does have some appealing aspects. 

Despite its appeal, I definitely see/hear a lot of systemic problems with my school's Greek life that are honestly just too much with me. 

Literally every frat at my school hazes in some way or another. For example, a person I knew was rushing an engineering frat and didn't  respond to emails quickly, and was then given research subjects and told to write papers on them as well as present them to one of the frat members. 

Most of what I hear out of normal frats is grueling physical exercises/punishment as well as humiliating stuff. Somebody yesterday who is a senior was telling me about the frat that he had been a part of(left 2nd year BC financial reasons) where they were forced to go outside and run a mile, then go inside and do a lot of sets of push-ups/sit-ups/whatever else until they finished. They were also forced to drink a handle/and strip down to their under and got kicked into a pool. 

And this was a frat that advertises their no-hazing policy. 

Also, misogyny is apparently an issue. It's an achievement to have slept with a girl from every Panhellenic frat, and even more so if you did it while having a girlfriend.

The Projects, class homework, and midterm were great. I scored enough to help me obtain that score. The final though, was worth 40% of the grade. I feel as the grading school was beyond stupid. Should I try to talk to the dean? I'm not the first person to complain about this class.

Grading scheme was as follow


Project:15 percent. 4 projects-Create 4 databases one to track.


Homework:15 percent: 8 homework assignments


Midterm:30 percent-1 midterm


Final: 40 percent



Literally the entire semester relied on our exams. It's as the teacher never noticed her workload and the class was beyond ridiculous. We had to base each project based on the suggestion of the previous project. YET! We finished all the projects, and the teacher/TA still haven't finished grading project 2, 3 and 4. 



I feel I was unprepared for the final. We had no feedback on homework, and on projects. The teacher and TA weren't the most helpful when going to their office hours when we asked questions. There was an obvious language barrier. ",11,0,1402.1070275666896,college

Second, what is it like going to an Ivy League as a poor kid? I come from a poor background, but I may get enough scholarships to afford an Ivy League comfortably.

also, how do credit hours work? for example, is the only difference between a 3 credit class and a 5 credit class the amount of time you spend in said class per week you attend? for how long do you attend a specific class? i know that, at least for my state, you need 42 core curriculum hours/general education hours. how long would completing all those take? i'm super confused about credit hours/semester hours/college hours in general, eheh.

Improving chances in college applications over a gap year.,"So I fucked up a bit. I applied to 8 schools, only one of which was a safety school (BU, which is also known for accepting / rejecting people kind of weirdly). I was waitlisted by 3 of them and rejected by the rest. I know that despite my best efforts chances that I'll get into the remaining schools through waitlists are very slim. So I am considering taking a gap year and reapplying to some of the schools while applying to a few more, safer options.

Is it possible / allowed for me to reapply to a school after being rejected? (Googling would suggest that I can, but I want to be sure)

 In the gap year I plan to build my profile a bit  and would like some advice on how I could do that. Currently, all I can think of are the follwing:

* Writing better essays (My last ones weren't great)
* Improving my SATs
* Doing an Internship

What else could I do?

I am also currently writing / coding a text-based adventure game (would submitting this in my profile help my chances if it is good?). Could learning a language possibly help? (It's something I'm doing anyway, just curious about whether it would mean anything for my college applications).

Thanks for any help guys!

Has anyone else experienced immense amounts of drama since they got to college?,"Has anyone else experienced immense amounts of drama since they got to college?

I've experienced drama here and there in high school and prior to that. But seriously, what the actual fuck? Ever since I got to college from day 1 the drama has been non stop and just continuously gets worse. And just when things are getting quiet, BAM! Someone throws another ball at you. 

Then all the people you were friends with at the beginning, at the end of the semester you all literally despise each other and want nothing to do with each other. So you try to avoid those people but they just don't let things go or leave you alone. Hell, it's hard for me to let certain things go but I don't go out of my way to cause drama just for the fact that I'm still angry.

So I'm wondering, is it just me and my circle of friends or do any other college students experience the same bullshit? Because it's seriously the most ridiculous thing I've ever experienced. And so petty. What scares me most is how I know it only gets worse from here on out.

Chances of going to University of Washington?,"I am currently a senior in high school, and recently began sending off applications off to my choices of colleges. All throughout high school, I have had a strong desire to go to the University of Washington Seattle campus.

---

But, the beginning of my junior year brought a massive list of obstacles that, in my opinion, have probably drastically lowered my chances of being accepted. My family faced a sudden economic challenge, with my dad losing his job, and our relationships suffered drastically as a result. I got a job, working a lot of hours, right after school, every day to try and support myself. I didn't go home much to avoid arguments, and as a result, didn't get an adequate amount of sleep most nights, skipped a lot of meals, and lost a lot of opportunities to work on school-related work.

---

This caused my otherwise ~3.75 cumulative GPA to plummet to the 3.0 range. It wasn't until the end of my junior year that things finally began to pick back up, but there wasn't enough time to fix the damage that had already been done. 

---

This year, in comparison, has been completely smooth sailing, and I have managed to hold a solid 3.85 (which has the possibility of becoming a 4.0) in the current semester.

---

In terms of my academics and extra-curriculars, I think I am otherwise well-off. I have over 300 hours of community service. I competed in a national competition known as SkillsUSA in the summer, and placed fifth in the nation for computer maintenance. I am the President of my school's SkillsUSA chapter, and I serve on the ASB Executive board. I have ran track since freshman year, and have switched between football and cross-country since. I have taken 3 Honors classes, and 7 AP classes. I also recently took the SATs for the first time, and got a 2020.

The only possible thing that could possibly hurt me now is my GPA. As it stands now, it is right at 3.34 cumulative. For the University of Washington, this seems to be quite weak. I have been considering going to a few of my old teachers, whom I have quite close relationships with now, and asking for additional work to bring up previous failures, but have been struggling with the morality of this.

---

In conclusion, I was just looking for some possible advice, suggestions, and/or predictions for my chances of getting in.

I believe all of my essays are quite strong, and have also written the supplementary options, but I don't know how much that could help.

TL;DR
I have a 3.34 cumulative GPA, a 2020 SAT score, moderate athletics, strong extra-curriculars and community service, and decent essays.

College Answerz,"Hey guys! This is my first time on Reddit, but I've been told that it's a dependable community.  Anyway, I've been working on this website (http://www.collegeanswerz.com/) basically for the past year, and I'm launching today!  The idea is that when sites like Princeton Review ask kids to fill out reviews for schools, the questions they ask of the reviewers are too general.  Thus, there are things about college that go unsaid.  Things that college applicants really want to know.  I think my site has more comprehensive questions that do a better job of prompting reviewers to talk about everything you'd want to know as a college applicant!

However, the tipping point I have to overcome is getting answers.  People always tell me that it's a great idea, but that it'll be too hard to get enough answers.  I disagree.  I think the questions I came up with are thought provoking, and that answering questions will be fun!  Anyway, my site is nothing without answers, and I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to promote it and get answers.  If you could answer questions for your school, and maybe get some of your friends to also, that'd really really be great!

"How to break the news of a ""low"" grade to my parents?","So my parents are paying for my undergrad. All of it. I'm taking no loans and graduating with no debt. I'm super grateful and thankful about that. Currently, I am studying computer graphics with an emphasis on front-end development and minoring in computer science. 

&#x200B;

I'm currently in my freshman year. 

&#x200B;

My parents *think* I have all As. However,that is not entirely true.

&#x200B;

I am taking 16 credit hours total.

&#x200B;

My grades (right now) are as follows:

&#x200B;

ENGLISH Accelerated (3 credit hours) - A

&#x200B;

Introduction to Computer Graphics (5 credit hours) - A

&#x200B;

Technology (3 credit hours) - A+ \[This class is basically where we apply engineering and tech skills to solve real-world problems\]

&#x200B;

Calculus 2 (5 credit hours) - Either a C+ or B- depending on the curve

&#x200B;

What do I do? My parents have high expectations for me, especially since I am Asian. I'm out-of-state at this university so they're paying more than my friend who is in-state. 

&#x200B;

They told me that they would be there for me and support me even during failures, and that I should let them know as soon as a grade drops so that we can figure out a game plan for me to improve (tutoring, supplemental resources, etc)

&#x200B;

But I don't know what to do. Calculus 2 is notoriously hard at my university. My university subreddit constantly roasts that class. Around 25% of students fail the first time they take the class and then have to retake it. I don't want to be a part of that 25%.

&#x200B;

And while I do enjoy math, I just am not doing very well in the class. Even in high school, I regularly got Bs, Cs, and even an F once :O after my freshman year. 

&#x200B;

I know my parents will still love me and be there for me when I break the news of my math grade. But I just need the courage to tell them that I am not that straight A 4.0 student they think I am.

&#x200B;

If they thought I had all As and a B, and then that B went up to an A, it would be easy to tell them my grade improved and then make them proud. 

&#x200B;

But notifying them of a grade drop is going to be tough. I didn't tell them about a grade drop once in high school (I let them find out themselves), and when they found out, they got angry, worried, and disappointed. The day they found out was filled with trauma. 

&#x200B;

Since I'm out-of-state and they're back home, it won't be as bad this time, but I can only imagine the lecture I'd be getting through the phone. 

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. 

&#x200B;

We have a test on Tuesday and if I do extremely well to bump my grade up, I should be fine, but what if I don't? What if my grade remains a C/B?

After that, the person am talking to just fucks off or talks to someone else. many people are making many friends right out the gate and here i am left behind. this to me is by far the most depressing, frustrating thing i have ever faced. i'll continue trying to put myself out there, however with what i've seen, its going to be really tough. I dont want the rest of my year to be like this.

I hate college and all it entails,"After I graduated i decided to attend community college in Santa Barbara as opposed to my own hometown, (Why, well SBCC is ""the number 1 community college in the nation"") which my mother refers to as the almighty fish bowl. I knew I needed an environment change but coming here was a brash decision and no one tried dissuade me. I work retail so you can imagine my overwhelming frustration with customers who come in expecting everything to be handed to them on sliver platter. Let's face it, Santa Barbara is full of snooty, rich people and they count for 3/4 of the demographic to which my store caters. Anyway, working in retail means things like stupid break initiatives, drama between other workers (because i work with only females... and I'm the only WOC) and my hours are now being cut which leaves me to writhe and cry and struggle to make up the last $100+ dollars I need to pay my rent in two days. I really feel isolated in this because here in the beachy, saggy city, everyone's parents give them handouts and I know my parents would try to help if they could but things aren't going so great back home financially, I mean my parents and younger sisters just moved into another house because our previous landlord decided to sell /then/ inform my mother and father. Speaking of which, my father was let go of his position (i call sabotage) for a ridiculous reason which I'm sure could have been used in a wrongful termination suit, but my good hearted, saint of a man father doesn't like to hold grudges or screw people over like the rest of the world so apparently does. And as if that weren't enough, the washing machine where I'm living doesn't work and now I'm going to have to find quarters to wash my clothes at a laundromat with my fucking invisible car.

"Dear Professors, Please Fail Us","It's no secret in the college system (i.e. private institutions that aren't universities) that grade inflation is ever present among us. My school is one of these small colleges that have fallen victim to grade inflations in order to keep departments and professors' jobs alive. It's a vicious cycle--if a professor grades too harshly (fair or not), he or she is often blasted on the semester-end course reviews and then gets attacked by the administration for lack of student satisfaction/for the amount of low grades in the class. Thus, these professors, especially those without tenure, are coerced into giving out generous A's and B's instead of giving students the reality check they need. Indeed, many students from my school end up going on to Master's programs that they aren't prepared for because they glided through undergrad with undeserved A's and B's and are suddenly confused why they're receiving C's and D's. I'm tired of seeing students who truly put in the work get nearly the same grade as students who don't put in the same amount of effort--and all this due to a battle between the administration and the faculty. Please, professors, if a student doesn't deserve the A or B, don't give it to him or her. Fail us. Teach those among us the lesson they deserve to be taught. Don't bend to the whims of the administration. ",1,0,207.30656460372663,college
Is it possible to opt out of drawing nude models in college?,"I plan to major in art and animation in college, which involves humans and animals, but I cannot draw nude models. Of course I'm interested in learning anatomy because I primarily draw humans, but not genitalia. The exposure of genitalia outside of the bedroom (the ""bedroom"" being between two adults in a romantic and/or sexual relationship beyond the eye's view) is strictly prohibited in my moral and religious beliefs. I don't understand why the human body has to be studied in the nude when alternatives such as wearing body suits or form fitting underwear would be able to serve the same purpose. You would still see the contour of the body, the curves, the anatomy aside from the genitals, etc. which are the main important parts, no? But of course, nude drawing is this ""sacred tradition"" that is elite to any other form of learning anatomy..

Anyway, since it would likely be impossible to have a compromise like that, is it possible to at least opt out of nude drawing for reasons such as mine? Shouldn't discrimination and ethics laws allow that? I want to follow my dream, but I also want to do so in a pure manner. (I live in the US btw, if that helps)",5,1,264.3240761778007,college

I am beginning to seriously regret my college & major choice - is this normal? Looking for advice.,"**TL/DR: I made my college/major choice based off of salary and job outlook and not off of something I actually enjoyed doing and was passionate about. Now I am beginning to realize the mistake I've made and I'm not sure what to do - I'm unhappy and I'm completely lost.** 

&#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old junior currently in his 5th semester at a well-respected technical college in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I graduated high school in 2016, not really sure about what I wanted to do as a career. I was a good student, graduated in the top, say, 30-40 in my class (so middle of the pack), and also got Eagle Scout in 2015. In high school I cherished three things, particularly: art, music, and primarily history. While looking for colleges however I realized that none of those three ""professions"", per say, made a respectable living salary in comparison with other career choices. 

&#x200B;

So, in a hasty panic, I chose the next-best option: I loved to cook and eat, so why not do something in culinary arts and hospitality? And so I found myself on the doorstep of Pennsylvania College of Technology and took a tour. My initial reaction was basically ""Wow, this school is perfect. Good social opportunities (it seems), great instructors, a perfectly blended combination of hands-on and classroom education"". So I applied and was pretty easily accepted. My first semester (Fall 2016) was fantastic - I managed to get on the Dean's List (requirement of 3.5 GPA) with a GPA of 3.73 and knew I had made the right choice. Perhaps this field could be a hidden gem. And this is where the optimism ends...

&#x200B;

My second semester (Spring 2017) was an unmitigated disaster. I finished with a GPA barely over 3 (3.07 I think). My kitchen lab professor and math professors were terrible. I was getting poor grades I hadn't really ever gotten before. And on top of this I had an internship requirement for that summer. Let's just say that this internship ended up being the most frustrating and crushing two months of my entire life, and we'll keep it at that. My third semester (Fall 2017)  was decent as I was recovering from my awful internship and took a break from the kitchen (due to the funkiness of the curriculum) and had classes that focused on my beverage management concepts. 

&#x200B;

Fourth semester (Spring 2018) was my turning point. Mid-February I had realized that I had made a mistake in my major choice and decided on either transferring to a new school (in which I'd run the risk of almost none of my credits transferring making my first 2 years at Penn College a complete waste)  or stay within Penn College's School of Business and Hospitality and go from culinary arts -> applied business management and hospitality management dual-bachelors. 

&#x200B;

So here I am typing this now with finals starting next week, my fifth semester coming to a close. It had been an alright semester, given that I have just switched majors over the summer. Currently though I am not very happy - my social life here sucks (the social opportunities here are comically minimal and most students here aren't that sociable anyways - and I'm more of an omnivert), there aren't that many extracurricular options that have garnered my interest (most students here aren't enrolled in clubs or the clubs are very, VERY small). The town, Williamsport, is void of anything fun to do. 

&#x200B;

I'm lost, and I'm not happy about the current path that I am on. Yet I feel like I've come to this realization a bit too late and I've fucked myself over already and now I'm just paying the price, figuratively and literally. I know that if I decide to change schools and majors I am basically rendering my education over the last 2-3 years obsolete and putting myself back at square one.

"My scholarship application, 300 words. Let me know what you think please.","This is an application for a scholarship to a community college. I am 26 years old and hoping to return to school this fall. The question asked was ""Share a significant experience, achievement, or ethical dilemma you have faced and what you learned from it."" I have not been to school in about 7 years so please do not expect perfection :) 

""Being a homeless drug addict struggling with severe anxiety and depression was never something I intended, I only began using drugs during high school to help alleviate depression. However, once I awoke in my car for the 2nd year straight, having not eaten in days and waking only with the sole intent on finding means to purchase and use drugs, I began to realize that my life had become devoid of any true meaning. 

See, that's the horrible thing addiction does to a person. It saps any soul and purpose left in their life leaving behind a shell of a human being,  one that spends all of their time working towards a daily goal of getting high or drunk, incidentally destroying the lives of themselves and those around them. I once was an accomplished violinist and intelligent individual with a bright future but due to a genetic predisposition, a troubled childhood, mental illness and poor peer influences I was dragged down further and further into the hell that is addiction. 

In the past decade I have nearly died from 9 separate suicide attempts due to depression, spent weeks upon weeks in isolation fighting the battle in my mind that is social anxiety, and relapsed several times on my road to recovery. In spite of this I am today, after much hard work, a clean and sober, mentally stable, and emotionally aware individual. Entirely confident and proud of the man I've become, knowing I've faced these battles and overcome them only with the help of others, my own strong will, and the grace of God. 


I choose now to pursue a career in which I may help those who face similar struggles. Hoping that I may use my experience to improve their lives, and truly make an impact on the world.""",7,2,597.8167382148378,college

Worst time of my life,"So I'm a freshman in second semester and I absolutely hate this entire experience. I enrolled as a physics major but had to swap classes to spend the first semester brushing up on my math skills. Come second semester, I take the normal level (instead of honors level like in beginning of semester 1) physics class...
This has got to be he biggest waste of time I've ever seen. The course is not in depth at all and moves incredibly quick. This will likely cause me to have to take physics 1 again because I guarantee I won't understand it by the end of this semester. It's so bad I don't even know if I can pass.
I feel like I should not have to self teach 90% of the content...and as a result I have no motivation to spend the next 4 years of my life retaking courses because they don't go in depth at all.

I'm also pretty shit at math but no other majors interest me in the slightest. Only reason I don't drop out is because I will think I'm a failure.

(Important Do’s and Don’ts) I started college at a major US University. Do not do what I did.,"You are starting college! Away from parents/home for the first time! Many of you are in dorm rooms! Here is how to not mess up!

I was in your shoes at the University of Utah in 2013. Five years have passed and I am a failure. My sister is going to Stanford this year and she is the opposite of me. I felt like I should share this disorganized rant of how serious this part of your life is. 

I am an absolute failure and a wastoid. I hate myself and self harm ocassionally, doing not a whole lot of anything, i have few friends and live in a small mountain farm town at age 23 with my grandparents, unable to keep a job. last time i tried college i had such a bad mental breakdown that i would punch myself in the face and got police called on me for publicly screaming and hurting myself, bloody lip and nose. no life or prospects for marriage or money. i hate myself  i cut myself. i often want to end my life and am in expensive drug rehab treatment. i hate myself. do not end up like me i do notnwish it upon my worst enemy

**School**

Take notes and study. Make friends with the smart people in the class. Don’t worry about missing out on “fun” that can be a good thing. Study groups and TAs exist- do not waste your/your parents/scholarship money!! Actually go to class and study.

**Partying.**

Avoid Alcohol. Avoid Marijuana. Avoid Marijuana. Did I say avoid Marijuana? Avoid drugs of all kinds actually, as well as the people doing them. Youll do best to focus on school and if you befriend those types it has an osmosis like effect. I am a college “failure” and I dropped out of school three times because of this. You ought to be filling your head with new information, ideas on how to help others, figuring your life out. Weed can destroy your college career.

A lot of people at this age(18-19) are naive and think some drinking and some weed smoking is a part of college life. These people rarely go far in life. Avoid them. I was one of these people. I left school and spent time in rehabs because years later when weed started making me paranoid and alcohol didnt give me the feelings I wanted, I did a lot of pills and opiates. At age 23 I am not in a successful place and I can trace it to me looking for chemical fun instead of becoming disciplined at age 18. It is a tragedy. A close childhood friend of mine died of a heroin overdose last week. Please do not alter your consciousness. Keep in mind in College I was the deadhead who took LSD a lot and smoked weed every day and did a lot of adderall. I regret ever starting because all of it led to me having opiate addictions and psychological problems later in life. Better to be a square than to be a burnout like me or dead like my old friend is.

**Sex.**

You are better off not getting too caught up in this. Be a gentleman and be good to female friends but ladies and gentlemen, you don’t want syphilis or some other venereal disease and you don’t want to have awkward run ins with one off sexual partners you have classes with. It is a distraction. It’s your choice and all, but especially to any young women reading this- I bet if you save it until you are married or in a long term relationship that is serious with a really good person, it has more value and less problems. In general treat this as another drug that can lead to all kinds of emotions, my personal advice is to be a prudish dork and focus on school, I was not. Who knows what VD I have. Gross.

**Watch out who you associate with**

Be careful to be friends with people thinking long term. This will be what seperates you from people who are messing around and not getting good grades. 

Like I said, utilize tutors, go to study groups, take things seriously. It is cushy in college but in the real world things can be gnarly(from my experience living without a degree, i failed everything and my first semester was great but I was too focused on drugs and esoteric bs and got in really bad places)

**Your safety zone should be:**

1.Go to every class
2. Take notes
3. Study those notes
4. Know your professors.


Again,


(my advice from experience)Avoid:
Drugs(including alcohol- seriously that’s the most dangerous drug)
Risky sex
People who are not thinking long term



I don’t want to see any of you reading this ending up on the street or in pornographic streams or movies(i dont watch that stuff anymore) or like I am, 23 living alone with my grandparents with a 1.6 gpa and getting nervous breakdowns every time i go to try getting a minimum wage job where i have been sexually assaulted in the past, yada yada yada.


 I am not trying to scare anybody or sound like a puritanical mormon, but these are things I would do if i had a time machine. You are free for the first time ever, be very responsible, I am a total loser do not end up like me, suicidal at times, alone when I am not around family, and in and out of intensive drug/mental health treatment centers.

Take your lives seriously for the love of all tht is sacred and holy.

And religion helps people maybe be friends with the religious kids I don’t know. You don’t have to be religious but that is all I have left.

Straight A student Got B’s [Please Help],"Guys I’m a total mess right now. My quarter is almost over and I know I’m not gonna get any A’s. I feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself. I started off rough in all of my classes this quarter, and I tried so hard to bring up my grades to an A, but no matter how hard I tried this quarter, things were only slightly improving, but not enough to bring me up to an A. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I’ve been crying almost everyday about this. I truly feel like giving up. I feel so stupid that I couldn’t get all A’s this quarter. I don’t know what to do with my self. Finals are next week, I don’t see what the point is in studying for them anymore since I can’t get an A in my classes.

I really need help. I know I shouldn’t be feeling so shitty like this, but I can’t help it. I’ve worked so hard this quarter and I still wasn’t good enough. Even my parents were telling me that they were proud of me that I did my best. But I still feel that my best wasn’t good enough. I feel like a failure. I’m a premed student and I know how Bs can get you rejected from med school.

I put a lot of my worth into my grades and I wish I can stop doing this to myself because I’m never proud of what I do. Has anyone else ever felt this way? How do you overcome these feelings and move on? I want to do better next quarter, but now that I know these Bs are gonna be on my transcript, I don’t have any motivation to do well anymore.

Reporting an incompetent professor,"I’m currently taking Anatomy and Physiology, and this is the professor’s first year teaching at this school (he previously taught at another school). He rambles in his lectures, is scatterbrained, and his answers are not even related to the questions that students ask. He also makes us feel like we’re stupid for even asking and expects us to know the material before entering the class. He has anger issues. 

He recently gave us a take-home exam and let us use any resources (easy A, right?) WRONG. The day the test was due, he went over the answers. One question was, “what is pH?” 90% of the class said, “it’s the measurement of acidity and alkalinity.” He said “If it doesn’t include “the measure of hydrogen ion concentration, it’s wrong.” And wouldn’t give partial credit. Our definitions weren’t wrong, it’s just not what he wanted. 

I’m frustrated because if he allows us to use multiple sources, it’s irrational to be this picky about answers, particularly when it comes to multiple-definition vocabulary like this. He did this with most of the exam. I wish I was kidding. 

The questions from the exam were ready-made and not even based on what we learned in class. There were organic chemistry and cell biology components in this exam; if I hadn’t previously taken those, I would’ve been extremely confused. 

It is extremely frustrating that the professor’s grading is subjective on what he thinks is correct. I pay too much to take this class and I cannot afford to fail. 

I would switch my professor but he’s the only one in our school that teaches this subject. Would it be wrong to report him?

Exempted from English 101?,"Hey Reddit, I'm an incoming Freshman at NC State Uni. 

When registering for classes, I was told (by my Advisor) that I already had an Eng101 credit. I never took an AP English or AP Language class in High School, and only scored a 35 on my ACT Reading/Writing. My advisor says that this is only the second time she has seen a Freshman English exemption in her ten years at the school.

Do you guys know of any reason why I might have been given an exemption? I'm not going to take it up with the school, as I've already been given an 'A' for the course. 

Should I try and take the class anyway so I'll be prepared for second year English? ",17,4,2262.5030923815043,college

"Once made my professor cry in class, Unintentionally","I was a Communication major at a mid sized university in Virginia.  This was my last semester in college and I was taking 18 credit hours to finish my degree in 4 years since I changed my major 4 times.  I had this particular professor for 3 classes, so I saw her everyday that semester.  She was really nice, extremely smart and understanding whenever I was late on an assignment or needed help understanding something.  One of my final classes was ""Argumentation,"" and she was the professor.  For the final exam in that class instead of taking an exam, we were paired in 2's and had a political debate with another team of 2.  Our topics were assigned to us and once we debated the rest of the classes voted to choose who the winner of the debate was.  My partner and I got assigned to argue FOR illegal immigration here in The U.S.  I'm actually against illegal immigration, so that made this debate a little more difficult for me.  Any way, the way the debate was set up, I open the debate with a five minute opening argument, the opposing team counters the argument, I argue again for 7 minutes, their team argue for another 14 minutes, and then my partner argues for 7 minutes, they make their closing 5 minute argument, the I close ours for 5 minutes.  Well, I choose to make our primary argument more of an ethical one.  Claiming that our country was built from immigration, Asian railroad workers, English businessmen coming because of religious persecution, Irish potatoe famine, as well as some economic pros of employing immigrants in The U.S.  I closed with a testimony I found from a man who came over illegally and created a business that now employs over 150 Americans.  The debate went really well, it actually ended up in a tie between us and the other team, which I felt was credible of an A or at the least a B.  So the next class session after that classes' debate, she was ""I want to address something that was went on in last week's debate."" At that point I'm like ohhhhhh fuuuck.  She says something along the lines of ""It was mentioned at all the immigrants came to America to better their lives,"" Then she starts uncontrollable weeping.  She proceeds with, ""Some immigrants were forced over against their will in chains and shackles by the same people that were 'claimed' to build our country. I think that argument came from an over-estimated sense of white privilege."" By this time everyone in the class has at least glanced at me one time.  My following class was with her as well, and she was a complete and total bitch to me the whole time.  She would barely let me speak without interrupting, and spoke to me with a very arrogant tone. A couple days later we got back our grades from that debate, our team failed and the opposing team got an A.  We tied the fucking debate and failed while the other team excelled. Her reasoning behind that was because making a moral argument in a political debate is a ""Red Herring"" and that's not what the project was about.  Politicians use red herring all the fucking time.  The point of the class was to teach us to argue, and I did that well considering half the class voted for us.  I finished that semester passing all of her classes, thank god.  I'd just like to note, I'm not racist in any sort of way what so ever, just didn't think about bring up something so fucking shameful in a debate that would hinder my own success in it.

Dealing with a very sociable roommate,"I'm a sophomore living in a double in the school dorms, since I had a decent experience last year. However, this year the school screwed up and never sent me the housing application until much later so I ended up having to be assigned a roommate with no input. So now I am one month into the semester and have some problems with living with him.

I'm an extreme introvert and like a quiet environment, hence why I spend the majority of my time hanging out at the library's quiet floor studying and watching youtube. But unlike last year, my roommate this year is much more sociable and it's really creating anxiety for me being in the room when he has people over. This is completely not his fault since he is still following the agreement we signed at the beginning of the semester. At the time I wanted to be fair and said it was fine for him to have people over and listen to music at a reasonable volume since I didn't want to preside over his habits. But now I am regretting it because I can't hear myself think in this room, and I am incredibly sensitive towards loud sounds. He listens to his music on a small sound system and brings people over to play video games and they just are shouting the entire time. I've been trying to ignore the noise with earplugs and blasting my own music in my headphones but I don't want to hurt my own hearing in the process of trying to create background noise for myself because sometimes he gets way too loud. I already try to spend all my time at the library and school clubs to avoid him. My roommate last year was great because he played video games with headphones like a considerate person so we got along great.

Right now he is listening to music and has a friend over and I can barely concentrate on my video games because all I hear is muffled music and laughing over my headphone's already high volume. But it's a weekend so it'd be completely unreasonable to ask him to tell his guest to leave. But on the other hand I really haven't felt comfortable in this room because I barely have free time to unwind in a quiet environment to watch some anime or play video games. So my question is, what do you suggest doing to deal with the noise levels when in the same room as someone else who likes music and having guests over? Should I just leave the room?

TL;DR: Roommate who isn't unreasonably loud is still giving me anxiety every time I am in the room.",8,6,401.0412868259488,college

Unemployment and Underemployment amongst college graduates,"Throughout my college years (still in college btw), I've been hearing stories (from friends and the internet) about how college graduates are graduating without jobs or working as a barista at Starbucks with a masters degree. In many of these cases, it is hard to get out of these jobs once you are working in them, especially after graduating college. 

I think that a majority of these articles regarding graduate underemployment/unemployment are completely missing the point. In my opinion, it isn't really about the economy or jobs being scarce. It all boils down to the fact that most students major in fields like liberal arts, gender studies, philosophy, etc do so without even doing their research on potential career prospects or even whether or not their degree is in demand. Then when they can not find a job 2 years after graduating, they complain about how unfair the job market is or blame their school for not helping them find a job. Well guess what? The job market isn't fair and employers want what they want, a relevant degree with relevant work experience. How about doing your research on which fields are in demand, then decide from there whether or not you want to go to college. I would hate to see you waste thousands of dollars or be drowning in debt which they would have next to no chance of completely paying it off. 

My friend's cousin graduated from college 5 years ago with a bachelors degree in gender studies and a minor in liberal arts. She is currently living at home with her parents at 27 years old, working at a coffee shop and has 150k in student loan debt. I also know of someone whom I went to high school with can't find a job with her hospitality degree. 

I was reading an online news article titled, ""More than 4 in 5 students graduate without a job. How can colleges change that?"" At first I thought that it was about the fact that colleges need to do more to help students prepare for finding jobs and networking. Which is true since the entry level-market has drastically changed. However, I am willing to bet that a majority of those 80% of graduating seniors without jobs, majored in fields yielding little to no job prospects. In my opinion, this is an important point that this article (along with several others) leaves out.

My point is that, unless you want to become a teacher or professor within those fields, you should probably study those subjects in your free time whilst majoring in something useful, (like engineering, accounting, nursing, etc), otherwise you're just wasting your time in college. 

We can argue about how interesting and intellectually stimulating liberal arts subjects are, but the fact of the matter is that they will most likely not lead to a job other than waiting tables. You can call me an anti-intellectualist or sexist, but I am basically pointing out reality. Not all degrees are created equal. ",52,22,1223.3067034926155,college

"I just cheated on a placement test for college...idk what I was thinking, I feel so bad now..","Hello. So I am an incoming freshman and I had to take a physics placement test for the college that I am going to.

The test was basically to see if I should be in the regular physics class which goes straight into physics topics, meaning I'll graduate on time, or go into an introductory physics class which teaches the mathematical aspects first and possibly not graduate on time or I'll just have to cram in classes over the summer.

I am pretty good at math, I got a 5 on the calculus BC AP test and I got an A in my honors physics class. My school didn't offer AP physics or anything, I got the bare bones.

Here's the situation:

The physics test was an online test, no time limit whatsoever and I needed to score a 24/32 to pass. Now this is just BEGGING for people to cheat. And I took the bait...

I pretty much never learned vectors for example in my physics class and this test was FILLED with them, so you know what I did? I literally copied and pasted the question onto google and 90% of the time, a question incredibly similar to that one came up and I just followed what they did. 

I ended up taking 3 hours to do a 32 problem test (since I looked up almost all the questions to make sure they were all right) and I passed with an almost perfect score of 31/32.

Now I'm basically guaranteed into the regular physics class and I feel so bad, I feel like I'll get karma and fail the regular physics class now...

Should I just suck it up and take the regular physics class? I know I am smart and I am able to handle hard work loads but just the fact that I never learned a lot of the stuff on that placement test makes me feel like crap. 

Again, I was so dumb and now idk what to do. I was so fixated on passing so I would graduate earlier, but that's stupid because if I end up failing the class as a result that would be even worse.

Should I just tell my counselor that I want to switch to introductory physics? But then she'll wonder why I would do that if I got an almost perfect on the placement test...

Anyways, I'm sorry, I won't be surprised if this post gets downvoted to oblivion but I've accepted that what I did was wrong and if anyone could give me some advice I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

Turned off by colleges with frats - are they really that bad?,"As I'm researching colleges, I'm finding that a lot of them - like USC, Vanderbilt, and Cornell - seem to have a strong emphasis on this ""Greek life"" thing. Mostly I'm reading the Unigo reviews and there's a lot of talk about heavy partying, rich kids, and frats/sororities.

To me (and lots of articles I find online), frats seem like cults. There's news on hazing deaths, being permanently shunned for leaving, rigid cliques, etc. I'm not big on the party life when it comes to college so frats are really turning me off.

Is there something I'm missing? Am I just exaggerating things? When I thought of college, I thought of smart, diverse people doing smart, diverse stuff - not wealthy party-goers living the Greek life.",10,0,43.25831228891181,college

Is it a bad idea to go to two universities at once?,"Hello reddit readers, 

I'm thinking about going to another university while going to the one that I'm at (Uni 1). The second university(Uni 2), though not sure how I even qualified to get admitted,  is very prestigious; Amelia Earhart, Neill Armstrong (the first man on the moon), and many Nobel Prize winners went there. University 1 won't let me double major but will let me go to another university while I attend it. I have financial aid for university  1, but obviously not for university  2. I can afford to be paying out of pocket for University 2. It's just... I went to church today and they preached about not having to work two jobs. I want to work 2 jobs for economical reasons.  I asked my friend and my dad for advice and they think I should go for it. They really support my decision to go to two schools because the second is so great and the first I have additional funding, besides financial aid, to cover it.

Thank you in advance,

Dismissed. Ex FWB turned counsellor. Advice?,"Hey guys! A bit of a background on my situation. I studied for 2 semesters in university. Due to reasons I'm not gonna mention my first semester wasn't that great and I was put on probation. Second was going well until I stopped going to classes and my GPA got really bad. I was planning to take a semester off and my leave got approved but I then realise that I've been dismissed.

Getting kicked out was one of the hardest things I went through. This was my dream college, everything..I wasn't allowed to apply again for a year. I do want to apply for Spring 2020. To get in i apparently need to have ""proof"" that I'm a disciplined person and that i'd do well in classes. I need 2-3 letters of recommendation which I'll probably have from all the volunteering I've done. I'll also need to write a letter about what I've been up to during the time that I was away. Any tips?

The thing that's stressing me out is that my previous FWB has just become an admission counsellor (he's one of 6). And he's great but it's just awkward since none of friends really know that I was dismissed. He might even take my interview(worst case scenario).

Can I get CAL GRANT after transferring?,"So I transferred to UCSD last year from community college. I met with financial aid multiple times before enrollment and asked about all of the programs I could be eligible for, as well as my community college financial aid office. Neither of them informed me of the Cal Grant and that as a transfer student I could apply for it, which if I had been informed of it, I would have qualified for it. This negligence not only caused me to take out loans, but has also put heavy financial stress on my life as a student. I can only imagine this information was intentionally withheld seeing as I mentioned I was a transfer student several times when talking to both college financial aid offices. They both pointed me toward the FAFSA but neglected to inform me of the Cal Grant which would have saved me a great deal of costs.

The struggle of a modern sunchild.,"When you're young. It's easy to dream of a beautiful world. Far away lands with mysterious cultures, foods and interesting history's.

It feels like it becomes harder as we get older to understand where to put our efforts in place. Which battles of the mind, heart and, body are worth the toil of the soul?

Ive spent years in fruitless efforts. Doing jobs without pay for the joy of them. Hitchhiking, backpacking across our beautiful country. 

In my last 13 years.. I had the unique opportunity to veiw some of the most beautiful and horrific things as a young man i could ever imagine. 

My desire to travel hasn't subsided but finances are a harsh reality. Having the luxury of having been to 46 state's met their people. Learned to Sail, Fish and live off the land. 

I am not the sharpest nail in the bottom of junkdrawer.. But, hitting 30 i started realizing im 80k dollars in debt between bills and student loans from 8 years ago. i have spent almost half my life walking up to strangers to ask for daywork or food but, have failed to setup a careerpath for my future. Preferably that would allow me to earn the money to purchase a 50' sailboat and earn money to repay my debts and then travel somehow earning a living.

I keep thinking i dont want to beg, hussle or grind. I dont wanna sell crystals on lott just to make a dollar to get by. For once it would be nice to pull my own weight in society. For the first time in my entire life i am attending old court cases and working twords a better tomorrow. I spent 10 years avoiding police now ive been able to look them in the eyes without fear.

I am usually full of ideas but, consistantly being underpressure and attempting to help the people you love can be emotionally taxing. Without getting into too many detail. I have been learning that we cant always help the people we love no matter how hard we try.

So why post this here on reddit? Ive spent 13 years on street corners from Seattle to La and, Colorado to Florida. Talking with strangers to solve my problems. I dont have a support system that is capable of helping direct my focus. So do what you know right?

Im looking for a Career that would let me interact with people individually and in groups.
 Travel the world to exotic places and/or allow me to work over the internet so i could travel of my own accord.

I dont want to get rich, i want to enjoy my life without being a societal burden. If anyone has ideas how to attend college in washington state while you have student loans in default and no current income. 

Or leads on a travel based job my fiance and i could be trained for.. Please let me know. I feel like the only bad question is one you were afraid to ask.

Writing my Undergraduate Thesis for English Lit.,"I had a rough 2018 and it really affected how I studied for university (especially now that I'm wholly self-directed).

Me and my supervisor talked a great deal about the ideas I wanted to put into the thesis. And I thought about everything over the past year. From society to evolution to gynaecology.

And now I've finally put pen to paper (figuratively) and have began writing my thesis. But after doing the first 13 percent of the essay, I thought it was hilarious that my thesis is starting to look like a manifesto.

I'm actually considering giving it the title of ""A Manifesto"" or something similar. It's basically turned from an analysis of *fucked up* novels as me and my supervisor discussed into a broad explanation of why society needs to be *H E C C I N wrecked*

I don't know. Is there any real issues with writing a manifesto as a thesis? With my current writing style I've secured straight Distinctions for my essays, and I plan to graduate with second class honours (I've accepted I'm not a HD student).

A guide for new students,"Things I wish I knew or I wish I had done as told. (Some of these may be obvious in this case sorry for that)

&#x200B;

1. Attend classes. There is no other way to see what your teacher prefers and what may be on exams. Books are good too, but sometimes you can understand better from notes. Sometimes teachers upload their notes on internet, but they may lack the answers from exercises, which were solved in class. Plus, how will people know you exist if you don't show up?

&#x200B;

2. Even if you feel depressed/tired/bored make an effort to show up. There may be lessons that are supposed to last 3 hours, but in reality last even 1 hour, because the teacher wants a break too. A coffe makes lesson better (if you dirnk coffee).

&#x200B;

3. If you miss one class, or two, get the notes as soon as you can form someone. If you try to attend but end up going to half lectures, it is possible that you will lack half of the taught material, which will lead to not having the proper material to study at exams.Half notes won't make sensecompared to all notes.

&#x200B;

4. Try to find old exam sheets from each teacher. If you manage two get at least two or three, you may notice what subjects the teacher has icluded on exam sheet more than once. Usually each perosn has favorite subjects they think are important to know in order to pass. You may be surprised sometimes to see that the teacher copies the same exam sheet each year (this may not happen in a respected university, I have seen it happen in mine though).

&#x200B;

5.If you have classes that unclude labs ( or other type of practical classes), make sure to pass these at the time they are taught. Usually it is easier to re-attend a theoretical lesson taught on a auditorium, rahter than lab classes which have limited amount of students that can participate and limited resources.

&#x200B;

6. Don't be disrespectful to any teacher (unless they have wronged you) or show obvious disrespect for their class. There will come a day you will need recommendation letters, so make sure at least they know you. Having teachers that know you shhow interest to their class will make it more likely to get you recommendation letters.

&#x200B;

7. Sititng in front rows can help understand better and see the board better.

&#x200B;

8. Usually if you help classmates, they will be more willing to help you (or not if they are competitive). You can't always do everything on your own.

&#x200B;

9. Older students doing a second degree can also be helpful. Befriending them can mean that you can be on a team with them (usually teachers tend to like them), they can be more responsible (thus deliver projects on time, so you know you teamed up with someone that will not show up with no work) or they can explain things you may not understand, if they happen to know. (If you happen to be friends with them, Idon't mean befriending them just to have a good team, this is shady, and of course young students can be responsible).

&#x200B;

10. If it is the first time living alone managing money and bills, it is tempting to spend your whole monthly amount on alcohol, but you will need food and tickets for bus.Try to plan  what you will need during the month. If you go out late, always try to have money for taxi, because you never know what happens. Also always keep on side money to go out, because a new group of people may approach you and ask to hangout you will have to deny if you are already broke.

&#x200B;

11. What you avoid to study now, will haunt you in the future. 

&#x200B;

12. Sometimes, you may not attend, or study because you need a break. Sometimes teachers change or retire, so the new teacher may me more srtict than the old one, or terrible at teaching, only for you to realise it was easier to pass the exams with the old one. You never know what happens.

&#x200B;

13. Some lessons may be abolished to be replaced with new ones if the curriculum changes. If you are unlacky to get caught between a change like this, if you had not attended and the lesson is no more taught, but still have to pass it you are screwed, or have to find notes. In this case, having had attendedwould have helped.

&#x200B;
14. Always check on emails and announcements. ",0,0,321.1643076592822,college
Urgent: Professor still hasn't responded to my request for an extension for lab due tomorrow,"I barely have time to write this post so I'll keep it brief: 

I have a CS project due tomorrow, we have one due each week.  Last Thursday, my eye starting swelling up and until yesterday my vision was so bad over the weekend that I would get headaches looking at anything and I couldn't get much work done.  My professor said If I needed anything over the weekend for the project I should just send out an email.  So I emailed my CS professor yesterday morning explaining what had happened and that I couldn't see until that morning and asked if I could have a 24 hour extension to finish my project.  However he still hasn't responded and he just sent an email to our class saying that the submission folder for the lab had been opened so It's clear that he is ignoring my email.  

Today It swelled up again so I went to my school's health center and it turns out its some sort of serious allergic reaction although we do not know what to.  I've been in serious pain today but I've been trying to finish the lab by the midnight deadline tonight and while I've made progress, I'm not going to finish it.  I know if I had an extra day I could have it working properly.  I don't know what I should do. I feel like I have a good reason to be asking for extra time but he hasn't even acknowledged my request.  I have never asked for an extension in college before until today.  I asked my Gov professor this morning if I can have an extra day to finish my essay and he said I absolutely could.  

My Dean knows me very well, should I reach out to him request his approval for a health-related extension?  I really can't afford a bad grade on this lab but do I even have another option here?

Lazy and Dickish Professor,"I'm sure something similar to this post has been done many times here, but I wanted to gain perspectives from other college students/grads about what to do with a shitty professor.

&#x200B;

I have a political science professor who's been teaching at my school for about 5 years, so I'm not sure if he has tenure but he is considered by the department to be the ""expert"" in his particular field so I'm worried he may indeed be tenured. Unfortunately, he is an extremely lazy and insensitive professor. I've actually decided to start keeping track of his poor actions over the last week or so, and hopefully I can build a legitimate case for the administration to at least look at his teaching.

&#x200B;

My first problem with him is that he is extremely insensitive and racist. Here are a few examples of his insensitivity and rudeness:

\- Said the Trail of Tears was ""very cool""

\- Talked about examples of workers' rights violations against women (i.e. in developing nations many women are simply fired for being pregnant), which is certainly an important issue, but then goes on to claim that the ""goal of capitalism"" is to exploit and abuse women

\- Following poor overall grades on the midterm, he joked that ""if you're feeling dismayed about the results, don't jump off a building."" This is particularly a sore spot as a student at my university committed suicide by jumping off a building earlier in the semester, yet he didn't apologize for this horrible comment.

\- When watching videos about child miners in developing nations, who develop severe health problems, face daily danger, and often die young, he said their situation was ""kinda funny""

I've only had this professor for about half of a semester and this is just what I can vividly remember and marked down.

&#x200B;

The professor is also extremely lazy:

\- Our classes last 75 minutes each, and for the last two classes I decided to keep track of how much time we actually spent learning information and taking notes. I intend to keep this up, since both classes I kept track of consisted of around 20 minutes each of legitimate class while the other 110-ish minutes were spent listening to some story about his family or watching videos that have little to do with the course material.

\- Our professor assigned a significant research paper and, despite multiple students (including myself) imploring him to post the rubric online or provide access to it well in advance of the paper, he declined to do so until 5 days before this 10-page paper was due. We are required to meet with a librarian to check out books, etc. so this was especially irksome.

\- He seems to say something along the lines of ""I don't know how we got behind"" in the curriculum each class - gee, I wonder?

\- He has assigned four homework assignments over the course of the semester. He has graded and returned zero.

\- I have arranged to meet with him twice at office hours. The first time, he wasn't there at the scheduled time. The second time, he emailed me to cancel last-second and I had to meet with the TA instead.

\- When the professor talked through the midterm in class, he was asked questions by several different members of the class regarding the professor’s grading. He couldn’t defend a single instance of grading a student deemed too harsh, offering weak answers such as “we’ll discuss that later” or “I’m not sure about that” while also directly contradicting things he said in class (ex: a classmate asked him why she got points off a question about the economy in the 1980s in discussing the implementation of Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) economies in many countries. The professor took points off for her mentioning this, and even when she gave him a multitude of examples within the professor’s own powerpoints and notes agreeing with her he still could not say anything of value to her).

Sorry for so many words, I am just angered that someone this incompetent, biased, and dickish can even be offered a spot at an institute of higher learning. I'm sure many of you have had worse professors, but I'd love to know whether I have any chance of making a difference or if I should just leave him a shitty end-of-year review and have that be it.

College Loop,"Hello everyone and thanks in advance,

&#x200B;

I attended Community College for 3 years taking basic classes like calculus 1,2,3, differential Equations, Linear algebra, Physics 1 and 2, general chem 1 and 2, and some electives. I had to repeat some because I failed the first time or wanted to get better grades then before to improve my chances of transferring. So eventually I transfer to the place I wanted to but for a different major, physics. I have been in for half a semester and am doing bad. Currently, failing 3 outta my 5 classes, But two can be easily recovered. I have busting my ass too this semester office hours, staying up till 1-2 am doing  work. I never go out our socialize, don't drink, or anything like that. And I am still failing. I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM TO BE WITH SOMETHING FROM MY STUDIES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I passed the classes but didnt learn much. So when the professor mentions something in a previous math class I have no idea what he is talking about. I really don't want to fail another class and have to be an undergrad for 6-7 years. This has given me panic attacks for months now, I go days without eating or drinking. I was considering about taking a semester off and relaxing, because I have never had a summer in college to relax(have taken summer classes since high school) or attending an online engineering college which was my first major of choice an completing that.

Am I crazy for wanting to take the SAT again after graduating from college?,"I graduated from a pretty well regarded small liberal arts school earlier this year and have been on the job hunt ever since. I graduated with my degree in history but never could quite figure out what I wanted to do (I still haven't figured that out yet but that'll come later).

Just last night a thought came into my head: why not check the college board website to see if my old scores are still there. Side note, I did very well on the SAT's back in 2012-2013 (M:800 R:710 W:710) which is the only reason I got into the great school I now have a degree from. Looking at these scores made me realize that there's nothing that made me feel more pride than when I got this score in the mail over five years ago.

My question for this subreddit: I was thinking about taking the SAT again, 50% just for fun and 50% to see if I could beat my old score with my new college education. Aside from the (seemingly wasteful) use of the $50+ it costs, is this a good idea? Do people take the SAT for fun as an adult? I was also thinking that a good way for me to make extra money or even a semi-regular job could be SAT tutoring. If I go down this path which is somewhat realistic, would it be beneficial to my prospects in the tutoring field if I could demonstrate my value as an SAT tutor by scoring highly on this new test?

Bottom line TLDR: Would it be weird for a dude with a bachelor's degree take the SATs for fun?",7,0,384.14944654817106,college

They where gone from the hall way and out of the suit in that time. My immediate thought was o good there gone! Not suspicious about why they where gone so fast... then I'm looking for my carten of cigaretts the next day and then it hits me! For real! In the time it took me to pee you where in my unlocked room, took my smokes and where out the door!? I told the office and they said they where going to speak with them. Nothing came of it of course, can't prove a smoke is your smoke.
But now everything I leave my room I am paranoid of stuff getting taken. That's 150 dollars worth of cigaretts!

Hell some memes will be gladly accepted. Ill probably type a lot so be warned.

Some background about myself, not really sure what matters so imma just throw in alot of info about myself.

\- I have decent grades, my gpa should be somewhere around a 92 or 93, and take really challenging classes imo.. AP/Honors all that. I think by my senior year i should have about 9 or 10 APs something like that.

\- My ACT score... i estimate/plan on getting something above a 31/32 still battling with that s\*\*\*

\- Extracurricular activities, yea not really. Im not very involved with my school, not a bout that life. Im pretty involved in the Video/Broadcasting club so theres that, doing a couple contests next year that I think I could win a few awards in. Besides that not much else. Did cross country and track my freshman and sophomore year but not like i got into JV or Varisity or anything but for what its worth I was there lol.

\- Ethnicity, one of the few things in my favor i think. Im hispanic (Peruvian if u wanna be more specific). Been moving around a lot in my life. Born in Peru, lived there for about 1.5 years then moved to Costa Rica (which side note... what a lit place) for about 11 years and the to Colombia for about 2 years and im now living in the US... Georgia for the past 3 years. So im probably gonna use the ""ethnic/diverse and international student"" card when I apply, gotta help their demographics lol. Clearly I dont know much about how the whole american college system works so thats why im here.

\- Bilingual... prolly goes without saying but yea Im fluent in spanish and english so yay... and I mean i took french for like 4 years, but I can ask to go to the bathroom and thats about it lmao, in all seriousness I can probably hold a conversation.

\- Colleges, something near Georgia would be nice so not too far from my fam. Anyways so far im looking at UGA, Georgia Tech (definitely a reach lol), University of Florida, University of Miami, Clemson, Chapell Hil? maybe idk. These are just some possible ones i've found. I really just want to go to a good college with a nice and fun atmosphere (ik thats obviously super basic but yea)

\- Career, definitely something related to business, so like Business Management, Sales, or maybe even financing

I'm 25 years old and just started college back this semester. How do I socialize without feeling like I'm surrounded by children?,"First off. I Just want to say I don't mean ""children"" in a (completely) derogatory way. I did several years of college right out of highschool, dropped out (long list of reasons why not all where under my control) and now Im back in a different major. 

Thing is, I'm 25 years old and in classes with people 7 years younger than me. Even as a senior in college my first time through I felt older. I went through some pretty heavy shit in my life so its not just about age. 

Anyways. I want to actually be social this time through college. Thing is, i feel like it would be weird for me to do lots of stuff. I'm not talking about frats (always hated those, still do) but stuff like clubs or even professional organizations (im going to bite the bullet on those for networking and professional development purposes, awkward or not). I mean. Im a good 5-7 years older than a lot of these people, which means less at my age but im very diferent than I was at 19-21 years old. 

Ive got a few things on my side. I look young (at my current job when I was hired I had a few other people think I was 18-19 years old, not 24-25, and by a few I mean most of the people I work with). I Live in my own house (abiet in non tradition student housing on campus,  but still its a house to myself). I have plenty of hobbies and stuff. 

My biggest worry  is dating. To be honest I was never good at dating, and now that I'm older I just feel weird even thinking about it with most of the women Ive met so far. They are just so....young. I mean they look like adults but a lot of the attitudes and stuff are still a little naive. I don't know how to describe it. Maybe its just mannerisms. 

I should probably add that the 3 years I spent not in college, those were due to health issues, I actually ended up isolated in my house for several years with very little in person contact with anyone other than my family. So Im also trying to reintegrate into society as a whole, which is challenging in its own ways since I'm super out of the loop about everything. 

Maybe I'm just overthinking all this. But i don't want to look back and feel like I wasted opportunites to meet people, which is how I feel about my first few years in college. ",15,0,627.2243192333563,college

My life seems pretty good, doesn't it?

Well it certainly isn't bad, I have a lot to be thankful for. But we all want to maximize our lives don't we? If you're given blessings why not try and make the most of them? I feel as though I'm not making the most of my life and that i'm wasting what I was given, i'm not being all that I can be.

My brother is 15, a freshman in High School. He ""has it all"" so to speak. He's my height, my weight, my speed, twice my athleticism and also better in school. He's going to be the starting quarterback for the varsity football team next year and he's also going to be on varsity for both baseball and basketball as a freshman. He's got certain things that I don't, and i'm lesser than him in that sense. I'm not jealous, I do my best to guide him and give him someone to look up to. It just sort of pains me that he's everything that I wasn't.

When I was a junior, I dated this girl who was perfect. A 10. Exactly like me in every way. Everything I had ever dreamed of and more. I lost her. I lost her because I wasn't confident enough in myself and she wanted more in a guy. Instead of accepting it, I got bitter and called her a bitch and swore revenge and all that. I didn't think she deserved good terms so I didn't give them.

Now i'm in college and the first month has been wild, but not necessarily in a good way. I've met a lot of people who've turned out to be fake friends, something I wasn't used to in High School because I had the same friends through all four years. I thought I was going to be best friends with these dudes from my floor, we played on the same intramural flag football team, went to parties and hung out like we were friends. But now they've double crossed me, because they told me yesterday that they're planning to get a house next year and since there's no five bedroom houses available, i'm going to be the odd man out. I don't know why this happened.

So now I signed a sophomore release and stuff and I have nowhere to live, I thought that these were my friends when in reality they're just guys who'll be fine without me. Not to mention, they told me I should try and link up with another dude i've been hanging out with to see if I could live with him, but this guy double crossed me as well. When I asked him to hang out tonight he didn't respond to my text, yet he was still chilling with other people. This was three days after he told me that he wanted to room with me next semester and that we're gonna be bros. I should've known not to trust him because he's double crossed people before me. But still, what the hell happened? What did I do wrong? How did I go from having friends to not having friends?

Oh, and by the way I quit baseball because I thought that these guys were going to be my social group and also because I wanted to put more focus into school. Plus I want to get a job up here by winter break so I can start working towards more financial freedom.

There's so much more to tell, and i'd like to discuss some of it with people in the comments, I just sort of feel lost right now, a little lonely. I should've known not to trust certain people. But i'm just sick of life being this way when it shouldn't. I shouldn't be a loner, I shouldn't be a loser. I should have friends and I should be happier than I am right now.",3,0,738.9278840481711,college

I'm scared shitless of college. What can I do?," I don't even know how to start. I’m a girl and I’m 18 years old. Last time I ate something was two days ago, I sleep maybe 3 hours/night. I have nightmares. I can't talk to people anymore. I can't even cry. I didn't even shower in days. I'm not scared; I'm actually terrified of college.
 
 In high school, I was pretty good at everything, at Foreign Languages, Literature, Mathematics and Physics. I worked harder for the last two, so I'm going to study Electrical Engineering (a little bit different from the American one, here it's only about electrical systems and power), but that's where my problem begin.

 How do I know if I will like it? I mean, how does anyone who didn't go to college yet know for sure if they like the major they picked? What if I fail all my classes? And if I don't like it, what am I going to do? I don't like anything like it's the passion of my life, but I can get pretty good at anything I work on. I'm really, really scared, I can't even read anything, including texts from my friends without freaking out. And I know they worry about their majors just like me, but I can't help it. My heart beats so fast all time and I can't even breathe normally sometimes. I'm in an awful shape and I'm scared that won't go away. 

 And I can't stay a year at home. I live in a rural area in Eastern Europe. After a year of staying here, I will be as clueless and anxious as I am now, because there is no one I can talk to. People from here didn't go to college. So that's not an option. 

 Also, debt isn't a problem. College is free here; I think I would go plain crazy if it wasn't. But moving in the biggest town in my country after living peacefully in a village scares the hell out of me. And switching majors isn’t that easy, because then you have to pay for your new major. 

 What can I do to easy at least a little bit my soul? I can't do this anymore; it just eats out my life day by day.

Is this even possible?,"Hi, first off let me address that I am a complete and udder noob when it comes to college, I mean I failed my first year COMPLETELY... So Yeah i'm trash.

So I attended college for my first year, My first quarter I failed, litteraly just stopped going to class, my second quarter FAILED again because I just ended up not going to class, third quarter same story FAILED...

I got lazy, I hated commuting to class every single day. I tried taking classes later in the day, it just ended up me being lazier and getting lazier. I even tried taking an online course, I was doing fine, then decided to not turn in any assignments then just from there decided to stop all together... So in the end, Technically I am on a 4 Quarter Probation.

This being said, my GPA is a BIG BAD ZERO (0.00) Straight ""F"" for ""Fucking Sucks to be You"" Now I know I can wait the 4 quarters to start up again, but would it be possible to just apply as a ""New Student"" and have something like a restart? It'd be a way of cheating the system if possible, and I don't know entirely what the chances of me are getting caught are (This is a larger sized College). With that also, What are the consequences of getting caught? 

I really feel better about things now, I mean earlier my life was in shambles a tad bit, just a lot of UN-necessary drama, and problems I had. I did feel lazy, and out of a mindset where I didn't want to go to school, but being in the position I am in I want to, I really want to pursue a career in Computer Science.

TL;DR

I failed my first year, with an accumulative GPA of 0.00 thus getting be Suspended for 4 Quarters. I want to apply sooner than that, I've got my life together in a sense and have a better plan when I take classes again. This 4 Quarter suspension has me in a tight spot because I want to be able to go to class right away. And I want to know if I have any other options. ",4,0,845.200673400023,college

Math majors - would you advise against switching to math?,"I'm currently a sophomore at a well-regarded LAC following an Econ major track.

Don't know where I'm headed at the moment...,"To give a bit of background, I'm a college student finishing up my 3rd year at a community college with a good amount of courses under my belt in Math and Science. My plan was to be out of here finishing this Spring semester but instead have been falling behind due to some lack of motivation for school work.

About around midway through my 2nd year of college I began having internal issues with myself which led me to struggle with school work. I thought I could just easily recover from it but have found myself to be digging a deeper hole. I began receiving low grades and they only went lower and lower as time progressed. This past fall semester of 2015 I performed a bit better and bought my GPA up to a 2.9, as I had it drop from ~3.4 to ~2.5 over a few semesters. But after Fall, my grades resumed to plummet in a majority of my classes. I've talked to a few friends here and there about how I feel about how I'm doing in school and I've been told that I may be going under some sort of depression. I've thought about it a bit and I do have anxiety issues and had moments where I felt completely miserable about where I'm headed in life so far, but still don't consider myself depressed.

To give my opinion about what might be the case, I believe I may have been doing more than what I should be able to handle.

In addition, lately I've also had other hobbies and outside projects that I've been working on which have shown me some results and have had me consider less about school and more about just working hard and practicing what I know so far and grow from there.

"Have an opportunity here, not sure if I want to take it.","Junior in high school here. My school offers college credit classes via the local community college. They now offer a program where if you earn six credits from them in high school, you can go to that college and get an associates degree for free. Now that's a great deal, but here's why I'm not sure if I want to take it -

1.I'd really like to move somewhere new, I've lived in this town my entire life and am getting bored with it (it's not a bad place, just getting monotonous). I'd like to move to a bigger city that has job/networking opportunities (will be majoring in some kind of engineering) and music performance opportunities (I don't plan on playing professionally, but I *love* playing as a hobby and would like more chances to do so outside of school). Also, want to be more independent.

2.I probably wouldn't take the college classes otherwise (I haven't taken any thus far, and would have to earn all the credits my senior year). I have the ability to do it, but feel it would stress me out and take too much time (I was in AP English for a month, and switched to regular English because it was too time consuming. But that may have been because of the teacher's style).

3.The college classes are taught by the high school teachers. I have/had them for other classes, and they're nice people, but it's hard for me to learn with their teaching style and I'm not sure if I want to start my college career with that.

4.I do have a college in mind that I would like to go to - University of Cincinnati - but I wouldn't be able to transfer  after getting my associates at the community college due to the way their engineering program is set up(or at least it would be very hard to). They do have a co-op program that starts your second year, and engineers make upwards to $19/hour in it. I'm great at saving (am saving now), but not sure it'll be enough. Cincinnati is the only college campus I've visited so far, and I plan on visiting other ones, but it'd be a good fit for me. Cost wise it's right in the middle compared to other schools I'm looking at. (There are other good engineering schools I can transfer to - Toledo, Cleveland - but from what I understand Cincinnati's co-op is the best and from what I've read will be the best for me).

5.I think I'll be able to get a decent amount of scholarships (GPA is a high 3.8/low 3.9, not sure exactly) and have decent test scores (which I plan to retake,so should go up). Also am about to start really looking for them, but again, not sure if it'll be enough.

Sorry this is so long, I've been thinking about this for a few months now. Number 1 is the biggest reason on this list, but cost of college is scaring me a little and not sure if it's worth moving.

"I am taking 3 seminars, how to survive?","Hello, I am a student at the UofT Scarbourough Campus, I am majoring in history and political science.  This is my fourth and final year at UofT

I am taking three seminars and 2 normal courses with tutorials.  This means a lot of readings and all of the seminars require me to do a 12-15 page research paper, all of them are due on the final week.  Another of the normal lecture corses also need a 10-12 page paper for the final assignment.  

Any advice you can offer me?
Some questions I have are:

1) How do I balance the readings for each seminar?

2) Is there a quick way to get through as much of the readings as possible so I don't spend too much time with one reading?  It is easier for one of the seminars as I am just doing 1 reading for my group(we divided the readings up) but I still have everything else to deal with.

3) How do I balance time in researching the topics for each big essay?

4) One of my courses has a midterm, how should I balance preparing for the seminars, preparing for the midterm and researching for the four major essays I have this semester?

5) I have involvement in a few volunteer programs, and I am involved in Model UN and the Political Science Association at my campus.  Should I drop some of the volunteer programs and solely focus on Model UN and my Political Science Association?

Second day of college and I'm having an awful time,"I have barely been at college for 24 hours and I'm totally miserable..
This is for a number of reasons.

1. My cousin was inconsiderate and came on our family vacation with a cold last week. Like a really bad cold. He gave it to everyone. I'm no longer contagious but I can't stop coughing. If I was at home and nobody could here me it would be okay.. But it's really awful to not even be able to focus on the president's speech because I'm turning red faced trying not to have a coughing fit.

2. I woke up in the middle of the night, the very first night, with a wisdom tooth infection. This has happened before but this worse than ever. My face is swollen, I can't open my mouth all the way, it's extremely painful, and I can barely eat. To top it off the health office is closed and apparently they're never there anyway. I had to have my mom come out (we live 45min away) and drive me to urgent care to save myself from being taken in an ambulance and being billed for that. To top it off the only pharmacy that's open today is an hour away so my mother is taking care of that while I lay down. I'm missing SO much important orientation programming.

3. It's hot. It's really hot. Tuition is $60k per year and they can't even put in AC.

4. My room is over the dumpster so the trash guys were there doing there thing very loudly at 6am.

5. I was home schooled. Now, that's not really a problem. It's a good thing. Even though I was homeschooled I am still a very socially capable person and I've made a lot of friends since arriving here. However, people always talk about the ""freedom"" of college. I don't feel that. More than anything, I feel trapped. At home I was responsible for myself. Sure I still had scheduling and obligations when it came to my job and my flight training but I guess I felt like it was my choice. I could drive wherever whenever, and I just felt free.. and sort of in the adult world. Now I'm back at school. I'm a freshman but I'm a year older than everyone else (not a problem, so is one of my roommates) so most people are fresh out of high school and this *does* seem like freedom to them. Not to me though. I feel like I'm in jail. I feel like I'm being treated like a child again... It's weird after working with and associating with mostly adults for so long.

6. I don't even know if I want to be here. This was my dream school. It has a 27% acceptance rate and I got in. It offers incredible opportunities and it is like no other school out there. But.. this is an art school... and that's who I thought I was before, an artist. However, in the past few years I have discovered a love for aviation. I've been taking flight lessons and I'm finding it to be a huge passion.. I've even recently been considering it as a possible job. I'm *so* unreasonably sad to be away from that right now. I don't miss home, I don't miss my family that much, I miss flying. I feel like my head just isn't in the right place. Before flying I probably would have been excited to come and focus only on art. My now my eyes are just turned towards the sky on this beautiful day that would be perfect for flight. I have my aeronautics textbooks stored away in my dresser with the intent to read them in my free time but I'm quickly realizing that I will have zero free time. This is a very rigorous school.. Which is fine.. I just don't know if this is what I want my focus to be though.


Now, I don't believe that things happen for a reason. Not at all. I don't believe in ""signs"" either. However.. I'm almost on the verge of wondering if this is a ""sign"" that I shouldn't be here. I'm laying here in bed because my mouth is so swollen and painful that I can't even eat. I'm missing out on everything. Again, I don't believe in any of that nonsense. I think that it's our choice to read situations whichever way we read them.. but I guess this is how I'm reading it.

I could really use some advice.

Is it bad that I'm probably going to end up taking 5 years to get my degree?,"Or even 6. I'm an undergrad who started in the spring. Currently in pre-nursing.

I have an Anatomy class I needed to take this fall. It was full but I got the override form and the proper signatures from the professor of the class and the dean so I could get in. I went to admissions to get my schedule and I was told I couldn't get in because I didn't have the proper pre-requisite (an english class). I was told that I could take that pre-requisite concurrently with Anatomy by the professor of the class. I told the admissions lady that, and she said that I wasn't able to do such a thing. So I ended up changing the class out for another pre-nursing class  I needed. I was pretty bummed out because the Anatomy class is only offered during the fall, and I also have to take another Anatomy class after that one. So that pushed me back a year from getting all my pre-nursing classes done so I could apply for the nursing program.

This happened a few months ago before the semester ended and now I'm told my a friend of mine who's also in pre-nursing that I *was* able to take that English class along with Anatomy. I checked my undergrad catalog and it was true that I was able to take them concurrently. So I got screwed over. Now there's only a week left before the semester starts and I'm not even sure I can get into the class anymore.

Should I study Computer Science or Engineering?,"I'm going into my sophomore year at college with a primary interest in computer science, so I've generally assumed I would end up studying computer science. I'm already ahead in the degree, opening up my schedule to explore other areas of interest too. It's also not a very intense degree at my school, but still well respected.

I don't have enough experience yet to know what I want to do, but I know I don't want to do web development, and the areas of CS that interest me most are the ones that are on the boundary of computer science and computer engineering. At this point most of the other areas of CS don't appeal to me nearly as much. I do have a strong interest in computer and electrical engineering and would definitely consider pursuing a degree in either if my school offered it.

My school only offers a general engineering degree, so I'd be taking classes in lots of areas I'm only mildly interested in. I can focus in computer or electrical engineering, but there's still all those other classes I don't necessarily think are worth my time taking. It's also by far the most burdensome degree at my school, though it's even more well respected than the CS degree. I may not be able to take many other classes, though I am already in a fairly advanced position in CS and I can probably take a class or two more in it.

So CS is just overall the more pleasant course of action. I could even take most of the engineering classes I'd want to take, but the problem is the difference between the degrees. I've heard that if I want to do a kind of CS-engineering mixed job, I would be much more qualified with an engineering degree than a CS degree. On top of that, if I decided to sway more into the engineering side of it, of course it would be better to have an engineering degree. And even if I decided to go into just CS, they like people with any technical degree and a strong CS background almost as much as CS majors. Basically, getting an engineering degree would open up so many more opportunities for me, from what I understand.

In that case I would go for the engineering degree, but I just feel weird taking a bunch of classes I don't really want. I understand why my school does that, because our theme is about getting a vast array of experiences in different areas, but I'm not sure how I feel about doing that when I could just get a CS degree.

I know this is really complicated and overall it's whatever I think is best for me, but does anyone have any input? Particularly regarding just how helpful getting a degree in engineering would be over a degree in CS?

Thanks!

I live in Florida, I'm a white female, and my GPA is 3.26 UW/3.3 W (I know, it's not great). My freshman year was horrible. Without going into excess detail, I've dealt with anxiety and depression for the better part of the past 5 years, and it hit an all time low during my freshman year. My freshman GPA was something like 1.88 UW/2.0 W. As you can see, though, I made a HUGE turnaround this past year. I took a break from traditional high school, and instead, I did my sophomore year online, and I ended with a 3.82 UW/3.88 W GPA. Also in my freshman year (2013), I took the PSAT, and I got a 199 composite score (56 M, 69 CR, 74 W). I don't think this score, apart from the Writing score, is indicative of my true ability, for aforementioned reasons. I'm planning on taking multiple SAT II tests as well: World History, U.S. History, and Literature.

The only honors-level course I've taken so far is English 1 Honors, but my schedule for this upcoming year includes APUSH, English 3 Honors, and Anatomy & Physiology Honors. My projected courses for senior year include AP Literature and AP Language (my school combines them into one course, taken senior year), AP U.S. Government and Politics, AP Macroeconomics, and AP Statistics. I'm considering self-studying AP Psychology as well. Also, when I graduate high school, I'll most likely have 6 math credits.

My parents are separated, and we have no contact with my dad, so I haven't been able to participate in as many extracurriculars as I would have otherwise, because I've had to dedicate a significant amount of my free time to helping my mother take care of my younger sister. However, in my freshman year, despite all of the things going on, I managed to found and later be elected president of a Gay-Straight Alliance at my high school. I was also a pretty active thespian; I participated in our drama club, coordinated club-wide volunteer opportunities, and performed in a local theater's production of Annie, Jr. I've also dedicated a pretty substantial amount of my time to teaching myself Adobe applications and CSS/HTML/JavaScript. Otherwise, I can't say I've been the most involved student. I'm looking to change that, though, over the rest of the summer and this next school year. I'm going back to traditional high school, so my plan is to rejoin the GSA I started, rejoin the drama club, start volunteering at our local domestic violence outreach, join our school's Future Problem Solvers chapter, and potentially join our school's Key Club.

Stanford Vs. Harvey Mudd,"Hello! I have been accepted to both Harvey Mudd College and Stanford University to major in mechanical engineering, and I am still trying to decide on which college to attend. I have attended the Admitted Student Program at Harvey Mudd, and I will be attending the Admit Weekend at Stanford in few days.

For a short introduction, My name is Matt, and I am an 18 year old from southern California. I'm a fairly social person, but I tend to like small (3-6) groups more than large parties of people. Because of this, I would rather have a small group of close friends than have a large group of friends that I do not know as well. Also for comparison, my high school graduating class is about the size of Harvey Mudd's total class, so I am a bit more used to large schools.

 I have been searching online for weeks for a direct comparison of Stanford and Harvey Mudd's programs, but I cannot find very much unbiased information. I tend to think of both colleges as being pretty equal, which is making me a bit indecisive about where I want to go. The only somewhat major difference that may affect my decision is the fact that after considering all scholarships and financial aid, at Stanford I would have to pay ~$5000 more per year.

"stressed out, how to handle it?","College freshman. Decided to take a 16 hour credit semester..anyways I am trying to get a 4.0 this semester as I got a 3.5 last semester.
I have been under a lot of work this past weeks and constantly having to rewrite essays and do extra credits even when my grade is a B+ on the assignment 

I have this class in particular that I did good on and have always done the assignment  on time.. But today I totally forgot.

It was due at midnight, and I did it at 2 am, I sent an email to my teacher explaining her my worries and that I really care shot my grades and that  if there was anything I could do I would do it.

Anyways the assignment  would make the difference between a A- in the class and an A.

How do I get over my stress? If she says no there is nothing I can do. ",12,0,1640.850360900023,college
"Math professor offended me, it's rather distracting.","Hello /r/college! So to cut a long story short I'm taking a Math course in a Computer Science faculty. We had a programming task to turn a couple of equations into a program that can solve them. Working in teams, since there were 4 of us, and 4 of the equation we split them up. We finished our codes and went to the professor for the discussion.

The program ran quite well, there were a couple of hiccups but nothing serious. Then the professor called for me. I was the only guy in the team and I decided to stay slightly back and let one of our teammates talk to the professor since the room was quite small and it was her laptop anyway. He asked what I did, and I explained that we split up the task and I took part x. He then asked me to show him part x and I did. I wasn't sure what to do, but apparently he was expecting me to say more, I then asked if I should explain the functions I did. It's all rather direct and I didn't have much trouble saying what does what, I did forget a couple of terms though and had to recall a couple of stuff. Then all of a sudden I find him accusing me that I copied the code from someone and just learned it. At that moment I was shocked, everything I submit is out of my own sweat and blood. Even if I ""copy"" anything, I usually defer to answers from the book, or similar examples that I follow. In the case of programming, everything I write is my own ideas. I learned what I needed to from the course book and translated them into the code, and that's what I replied to him with. Frankly I got really flustered and couldn't focus properly for the rest of the discussion.

In the end, we all got full marks, but I still feel really offended if that's what my professor thinks of me. Some guy who just copies other people's work. I realize that I may have let myself get easily offended- and that probably worse happens in ""real"" life, but I just can't seem to shake it off... Any suggestions? ",10,0,1668.7294465481712,college
REALLY confused... [X-Post from /r/applyingtocollege],"I'm taking a year off after I finish high school this year, and since I thought I wasn't gonna go to college, I never really paid attention to anything about it. Now I've decided to go after I take a year long break, and I've decided to attend an online college. I want to [major in psychology.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/2y3wcg/i_want_to_major_in_psychology_and_get_the_highest/)

How do I go about applying when the time comes? When would be a good time to apply? How can I decided which schools I want to go to? And I'm confused about which schools would be good, because of the explanations people gave me on my thread I've linked to above. I'm confused because I still really don't know what graduate/undergraduate schools are, etc.

I also never took the SAT, so I know I'll have to do that, as well as apply for FAFSA. How do I do that?

Also... I always said if I go to college I would always start at my local community college, but now I'm not so sure - Would it be good to start there, or should I go right to a four-year school? What schools will be good for me which I could get a psychology degree in? Do online colleges have academic advisors who I could email with any other questions?

I will never pass math and earn my BA,"Anyone else feel this way? I am a senior political science major and I am currently taking my fourth semester of math...my degree only requires one. Since I couldn't score high enough on my ACT to take regular math, I'm taking ""bonehead"" math. That's when math is split into two semesters. I passed the first half my first semester, but I'm currently retaking the second half...for the THIRD time.

I've been taking math for half of my college career. TWO YEARS to earn ONE. FUCKING. CREDIT.

I'm supposed to graduate this fall. Supposed to. I'll probably fail math again. I failed math in 5th grade which landed me in remedial math. I failed it again in 8th grade, which landed me in summer school. In 9th, 10th, and 11th grade, I passed with D's because my teachers liked me. My senior year of high school, I was able to take conceptual math instead of trig and I earned a C. I've been denied NUMEROUS FUCKING SCHOLARSHIPS because I'm bad at math. I'd have a full fucking ride if I didn't earn a 29 on the math portion of my ACT. I just needed a 30 for Promise. Go figure. Sure, I earned within the top 5% of test-takers in my state for the rest of the ACT test, but what really matters is earning a 30 on math to get a scholarship.

I'm sick of people telling me to go to the professor or go to a tutor. You think I haven't done that shit in the two years I've been stuck in basic math? You think I haven't spent late nights doing my labs? I've been to the tutors. I've asked my professor for out-of-class help. I spent an hour a night with one of my best friends studying for finals. Which, by the way, at my school if you get below a 60% on any math final, you fail the class, no matter what you get in the class overall. I'd have passed my last math class with a B if that policy weren't in place.

This is bullshit. Math is bullshit. My essays have been used as models for other students. I've tutored in my subject. My favorite English professor had one of my term papers published in a literary journal. I can't pass math despite working my fucking ass off more than I ever have in my life for a basic fucking algebra credit. And I still can't earn it. I'm literally one fucking credit away for my degree, but I'll probably never graduate college because of it. I'll probably drop math this semester and focus on it in 2016. Just ONE LAST CLASS to pass for that year. I'll probably be spending a whole semester on it, but I'm ready if it means it'll be the final nail in the math coffin.

How well do my credentials stack up as a freshman applicant to UCLA? Would they be better suited to a different school?,"I'm from Washington and UCLA is my goal school, where I plan to major in Business Economics. As application deadlines draw close, I'm probably over-stressing myself by making sure it's perfect.. I guess this thread is just to assuage my worries a little bit. Anyways, here's a little mini-application to look over if anyone wants to help. Thanks!


Preemptive TL;DR: Above average GPA with solid(?) extracurriculars that focus on creative (audiovisual) pursuits.


ACADEMICS:

- 3.6 Unweighted GPA (this is the weak point of the application)

- 4.0 Weighted GPA/4.09 fully weighted UC GPA

- Video Production/Visual arts/Music centered electives

- 1990 or 1970 SAT. I'm not sure which to send - the higher score is 600CR/690M/700W but the lower is 690CR/680M/600W which is essentially the opposite. Does UCLA care more for critical reading or writing?
- 21 AP/Honors semesters 9th-12th grade (17 from 10th-12th)


AWARDS:

- AP Scholar with Honor (earned for receiving a score of 4.5 across 4 AP tests)
- National Merit Scholar Commended Student (earned for receiving a 216 on the NMSQT, the second highest score in my class)


COMMUNITY SERVICE:

- YoungLife Leader (~9 hrs/week between meeting and planning)

- National Honor Society (3 years)

- 3-time facilitator/MC of the Game of Life (local annual community event ran by the police department & youth members to teach kids/teen about safety/prevention/etc.) 


WORK EXPERIENCE:

- Event Staff/Supervisor at Clowns Unlimited (Washington company that organizes events/parties and rents out rides)

- Freelance/Self-employed Audio Engineer (Audio engineering has been my hobby for years and I've assembled a very nice studio in my basement where I rent out studio time and mix raw audio from people around the country, for a price)


EXTRACURRICULARS:

- S.T.U.D.I.O Club - This is the high point of my application. Because of my passion for music and music production, I started a club to teach musicians about sound engineering and how to create a marketable image for themselves. Through this, I have headed the creation of a campus radio station where we play members' songs in rotation with ""real"" studio-produced songs. There are high and realistic hopes that this club will turn into a real, for-credit class next year after I graduate.

- News anchor/editor for my school's video announcements

- Member of the Kent Police Youth Board (youth members of the local Police Department, participate in community service and education like the Game of Life I mentioned earlier)

- DECA (1 year, my event is individual retail merchandising)

- First-chair upright bass player in orchestra (2 years)

- **ALSO** I'm planning to do a school musical either this winter or upcoming spring. I shouldn't write about this in my app preemptively, should I?


PERSONAL STATEMENT:

I'm a strong writer (700 SAT writing score) so I think I got this covered with some editing help from my AP English teacher. However, any advice would be great!


TL;DR: Above average GPA with solid(?) extracurriculars that focus on creative (audiovisual) pursuits.

"Thoughts on my college list, and maybe some recommendations on where to apply?","I'm a student in Georgia with a 3.91 weighted GPA (my school only weights AP courses, not honors or accel), and an estimated 3.75 unweighted GPA because I'm too lazy to calculate it right now. I have taken 5 APs through my junior year and will graduate with 7. 

My ACT composite is a 34. Math 32, english 34, reading 35, and science 36, and an 8/12 on the writing.

My class rank is around 27%, because I go to one of the best public high schools in the state. 

I have some solid ECs, my highlights being an internship at my local hospital's ED, and being the founder and leader of my high school's rugby club for 3 years.

I'm one of those upper-middle class kids who is well off enough not to need any financial aid, and is going to receive some help from my parents, but I'm still going to be paying the brunt of my college. So I'm definitely factoring in lucrative scholarships to my search.
 
My college list is pretty sparse right now. Any suggestions are welcome. I'm really not sure where I want to go yet.

Reach: Tulane, and maybe Emory

Middle: U of Georgia (full tuition)

Safety: U of Alabama (full tuition), Temple (full tuition)

My roommate found a master key for our entire floor. (Story inside),"First off, I have three other roommates in a suite-style dorm. We'll call them Jeremy, Josiah, and Christopher.
So, Friday Josiah said that he came back to find our room unlocked with a key in the door, so he just put the key inside anticipating someone to come back and ask for it. Little did he know that the key was the master key for the entire fourth floor. Fast forward to yesterday, Labor day, Josiah had gone home for the weekend, so it was just me, Jeremy, and Chris. We were just hanging out in the commons area of our dorm when I noticed the key sitting on the table. I wondered what it was, so I asked, but neither of them knew of its origins (we didn't ask Josiah about it until after he got back late Monday night.). We all thought it was a normal key, until we took it and unlocked all of our private rooms with it. Jeremy took the key at one point, unlocked another suite, but locked it back quickly (none of us wanted him to.) But after all of that was over we took it to our RA. he claimed that he didn't recognize the key because the master keys for the RA's apparently look different. 

I have a few questions:

Did we do the right thing by taking it to the RA?

could it have been a maintenance crew or something?

Should I be worried that there might be copies of that key and someone is going into the dorms on their own free will?",12,0,1868.9115530296526,college

"Am I crazy, or is something weird going on with my department? Really, am I crazy?","I'm a junior who was supposed to start nursing school next week. Except I'm not. My department is screwing me over. The problems started in the fall. I had taken all of my prerequisite classes but two, and you needed permission numbers to get in to the classes. I did everything I was supposed to do, and my advisor said ""oh, we'll send you the numbers next week."" But she didn't. Then, the next week, I emailed and she told me I would have to wait for grades to post, and the next week she told me to wait for some processing. Then the school closed for Christmas. When it opened back up, I emailed and emailed and emailed, and then the classes were all full. So I had to spend my time and money taking a chemistry class instead of what I was supposed to be taking. Well, I called to complain, and the advisor had left a few days before. I had no advisor for 2 months. Well, it was all okay, because I could just take the classes that summer. The next problem happened when I was supposed to get my acceptance to nursing school. My school has a policy that qualified students who started out as a freshman have automatic acceptance. I qualified and was guaranteed by my old advisor that I would get in. Then, come April, I didn't. I called my advisor, and she didn't answer. I tried to make an appointment, but she was booked up. I even called the dean of the department, who sent me straight back to my advisor. Finally, I got an email saying that she had a cancellation and she'd meet with me. I actually got my parents to go with me, because they obviously don't listen to me, so I thought they'd listen to someone who paid the tuition. Well, we finally got her to look at it, and surprise! There had been a clerical error and I was supposed to be admitted. Well, I got admitted two days later. Now I had to get the permission numbers for summer. I had to email almost every day for two weeks before she finally let me have them, the day before class starts. Well, my classes started for the summer, and I started struggling with one of them. Now, I'll just say that my grades have never been perfect, but if I'm not doing well, I won't go down without a fight. So I went to her office every week asking for tips, studied for 2 hours every day, went to every class. Then my homeworks and quizzes started disappearing off of Blackboard. Like it never happened. I'd taken them and made good grades, but they were not even showing up. It was ridiculous. I asked her for study tips all the time, talked to my (different) advisor several times, worked really really hard. But I only made it out with a 72. (Nursing classes consider a 74 or lower failing.) Now I'm a semester behind. So I called my advisor, who sent me to my old pre-nursing advisor to get the permission numbers ONCE AGAIN. It's been a week, and I still haven't heard back. 

I know that I'll sound crazy for this, but I think they're trying to get me to drop out. Withholding permission numbers, rejecting me from the school? I think they're trying to weed me out because I only have a 3.0 GPA when most of the other kids have a 4.0. We have one of the highest employment rates (97% of graduates have job offers before they even graduate) in the state. It's like they take the kids who are most likely to fail, and make them fail before they can mess up our statistics. I know that failing the class was on me, but everything else feels so out of my control. I feel like they're just playing me like a marionette! Am I crazy?

TL;DR: Feel like department is trying to weed me out through immoral means before I start the program. Also might be paranoid.",2,0,1886.888034511134,college

Algrebra,"Okay, um. I'm a high school senior close to graduating in a few months. My favorite subject is math but it's the subject I feel I'm most lacking in. I took Algebra 1 in 8th grade and it was fairly difficult to me due to both me not understanding it and my lazy nature. I got placed into Pre-Geometry in 9th (because the actual Geo class was too full) so I basically took a year 'preparing' for Geometry. 10th grade came and I was placed in Geometry and I flew through the course with the same lazy nature I had but everything just clicked when it came to Geo. 11th, I was placed into Algebra 2 / Trigonometry and this time, I was placed into the class a few weeks after the year started. So I hadn't done algebra in 3 years basically and I was behind everyone else. I struggled through Algebra 2 not understanding many things (and still don't) but when the Trig semester came, I flew through it like I did with Geo. I came to the conclusion I'm better with Geo and Trig but Algebra gives me a harder time. I tried going online for some help on math websites and I understood SOME stuff I didn't before but still some stuff did not stick. 

Now the question is, should I work on refining these skills in preparation for college? Will all of them be necessary right off the bat in my first year or will they sort of review it (which could help me understand more)?

First year about to fail out of college and it's my own fault--need help and advice,"I feel absolutely terrible about this but more than that I feel terrified. 
I am 19 and I've never been a strong student responsibility wise, I mean, I know that I'm smart, but laziness, procrastination and a self depreciative fear of success worked towards me barely making it by as I did in highschool, two failed classes, no tuition money due to my student loans not being released because of mistakes in the banking information. I've been trying to get a hold of the national student loans service but I only woke up to what was about to happen a few days ago and school starts tomorrow so they've been busy with thousands of students and I can't reach them. Because of that they've withheld any courses from me. I still have a chance but only if I can hand in several assignments and secure the student loan in time--I don't know if there is enough time.

The worst part is that I've had so many opportunities to fix this, to get myself and my old self depreciative feelings together. Proffs have reached out to me and given me dozens of chances and the student Loans Services have called my house almost everyday for the last 4 months-- there really is no excuse other than that I messed up. I wasn't used to being responsible for myself and I made little effort to try to, also placing other things above school work.

I want to fix this before it becomes one of the lowest points of my life. I want to believe I've learned my lesson and that if given another chance, even though I've had so many before, I can make things right for myself. 

Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading",1,0,2107.463057659282,college
"Almost college student, freaking the freak out!","Alright, reddit. I've lurked on here for about a month or two and I've come to the conclusion that the community here is for the most part really helpful.

But anyways, I'm looking for some help in deciding a major. I live in Michigan, and plan to go to a community college before transferring to a bigger university (Wayne State). I'm moving out when I turn 18 with my boyfriend (who I have been in a relationship for two year counting) due to some family issues with my stepmother, so I would really like to get some ideas and help so I can figure out what direction I should be heading into.

I really like studying sex. I know, it sounds weird coming from a 17 year old, but it's true. I love all the aspects of it. I also love teaching people my age about their bodies, and how their bodies can interact safely with other peoples' bodies. My first spark of interest in this topic was in health class when I realized my sex education was being given a pamphlet of STI/STD names and told to research them (typically fear-based abstinence-based education). I also like Biology. Two of my favorite YouTubers are Dr. Doe and Laci Green. I've been leaning towards a Bachelor of Arts in Biology (I don't do well with advanced mathematics so this is the best option for me I hope.)

So, Reddit, would you be willing to help me out? I really just need advanced because I have NO IDEA what to do and a lot of people I've talked to are weirded out by my interest in sex from a health/science perspective. I'm not opposed to teaching H.S Biology, but I'm just not sure whether the job market for that field will be increasing like Health and Technology careers are supposed to be.",3,0,2108.065384048171,college

MIT Chances,"**WARNING. SEMI-BRAGGING ALERT.**
You have been warned.

I'm a senior in high school, and I'm applying EA to MIT.  I really want to study mechanical engineering there, and when I visited campus, I basically fell in love with the place.  I've done well consistently throughout school, on the SATs, but I didn't do too well on my subject tests.  I know that my stats look really good on paper, but how well do I stack up against the MIT admissions standards? I know they're insanely, insanely selective with admissions.

Buuut, I know it's hard as balls to get in.  Do I have a shot? How badly will my crappy subject test scores affect my chances?

* 4.65 weighted GPA (I think on a 5.2 scale, which would be all honors/AP courses, all 100s, no gym, nothing else)

* 2250 SAT score, 790 CR, 750 M, 710 W

* 660 Physics and 700 Math 2 scores (retook in October, hopefully did better)

* Top decile in class (ranked 5th in senior class)

* Eagle Scout (woo hoo, does this really mean anything at a top-tier school like MIT?), held positions of responsibility in troop for past 4 years

* Positions of leadership in 2 school clubs (Model UN website manager and delegate, school radio station DJ and program director this year, production manager last year)

* NHS, but barely squeaked by w/ volunteer hours

* Italian Honor Society (may be kicked out due to inactivity, not my fault)

* Varsity fencing 3 years straight

* Took every available math course in my school (including Linear Algebra, which is taught w/ a MIT curriculum)

* Took a college symbolic logic course over the summer

* Volunteer work with local Red Cross, Scout Camp, and local soup kitchen",12,0,2191.1609627518746,college

Organizational Communication Major. Wondering if I should add a minor. (semi-walloftext),"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a Org Comm major who is less than 40 credits away from graduating. This will be my second year at the school I transferred to and wondering if I should add a minor to my major. 

The thing is, I was originally a nursing major at a CC where the nursing program was amazing the situation was there was a two year waiting list and people usually didn't get in within the first two years. I would have transferred to another school to get my nursing done but after doing my clinical, I decided the nursing field wasn't for me (I loved it but my heart wasn't in it).

So I decided to transfer to a private school (due to it being cheaper with scholarships and grants..a lot cheaper than the public state school) and decided to change my major. In a way I feel like I made a mistake with my current major but at the same time, I feel like I'm a Jack-of-all trades with all the courses I have under my belt. These courses from my prior major were nursing courses, psychology courses, mathematics courses, and chemistry courses. Then there is courses that covered the basic aspects as well (humanities, English, etc). So I'm pretty diverse with the material.  

My current school put all these courses together and made a package for my major which was approved but now I'm wondering if I should add a minor in econ or marketing.

My original plan was to go to Law school after undergrad but being a first generation college student making it on his own, I decided I wanted to go into the career field instead and pay down my loans. Depending on what happens down the road, I might still go back for Law if works out.

Sorry for the rambling but...should I add a minor in econ or marketing?",1,0,2318.466796085208,college
"Low cumulative GPA, need advice","This is long, but I really could use some help here.

For some reason I just never really tried in school.  I've been told I'm smart by a lot of people, but just never found the interest to commit myself.  Often times I never did work for classes simply because they were boring and uninteresting.  I used to have this mantra in high school: ""you and I, we both hate homework.  the difference is you do it anyway, and I don't.""

I did horrible my first semester of freshman year.  1.17 gpa.  I know I'm not alone in having a dismal freshman year, but honestly... I've had a dismal semester *every* semester, except last fall, when I pulled a 3.06... my highest GPA yet...  Which is honestly still pretty low.  My overall is a 2.44, but for the classes related to my major (history) it's a 3.09.  Even this past spring semester to close out my junior year, I got a C+ and D and got a 2.66.  However I think I will be able to graduate in 4 years and still be able to minor in something (I was thinking sociology maybe).  I only need 30 more credits.

It's only been recently, and by recently I mean within the last year or less, that I've genuinely realized I should be trying hard in school, and started to feel like crap for getting low grades.  Coming into college as a history major I wanted to be a teacher, but now I don't really want to anymore.  However I do want to go to grad school. I've read and heard so much that grad schools pretty much don't take anyone under a 3.0 gpa.  Like, they'll just look at your gpa, if it isn't above 3.0, then your app goes to the shredder.  That is horribly elitist and intimidating for someone like me, especially given that 1.17 gpa...  I just have no idea where I'm heading because I'm slowly but surely realizing I just blew the past 3 years of my life and royally fucked everything up before I even got a chance to start my life...  It's a really depressing attitude to have, but I just can't shake the feeling that it's true.

I'm looking for advice on what I could do for grad school, how badly I screwed myself over these past few years and if I still have time to make up for in my senior year, and just basically anything that can put my mind at ease and give me a more positive attitude going into the future.

College Roommate Sells Drugs,"As the title says, let's just say that in theory that someone has a college roommate that sells drugs. And in theory, when someone was first assigned to him, in a college dorm, they were a bit worried because they knew he smoked weed.

They personally have never smoked it, and don't plan on it, but don't mind if people do what they want unless it affects them. Recently though, said person's roommate may have had druggies knocking on the doors late at night asking for said roommate, while he's out partying. When this person's roommate comes back later, they tell him about these people, someone comes back and buys nearly $100 weed cartridges from the roommate.

"On Chinese ""Prep Agencies"" for Overseas Western University Admissions","Tldr version - Wealthy Chinese students uses cheating prep services in order to gain admittance to Western universities and schools.

Hi all, in light of the recent US college admissions scandals, I just wanted to share some of my experiences regarding Chinese prep agencies. I am not an education professional, but I have worked closely with clients who runs some of these agencies.

Feel free to AMA on any questions on these agencies, business and corruption in China in general, or anything at all regarding life here.

Prep agencies in China come in all types and tiers, and tutoring services are the least that they offer. Want your kid to get into a prestigious local elementary? Know the right agency, and they can get you in touch with the school's administration or director. After that, they'll organize a meet (usually a dinner function) and you can ""songli (give gifts) in the form of money or other types of valuables. Depending on the school, gifts may be anywhere from 2000-400,000Yuan (300-60K USD). Strings will be pulled to admit your kid, and everyone's happy except the other kids that weren't admitted.

But elementary schools are the least of anyone's worries. To put it another way, no one in China cares about corruption on that level, because it's extremely prevalent and seen as normal. The recent US college admission scandals, where a student paid $6.5M to get into Stanford? You bet most students and their parents will opt for that option, if they had the means. But that's only for the extremely wealthy families, with accessible connections in the West or impressive monetary or political influence. Since most do not, they have to rely on Chinese agencies if they want to study overseas.

What do prep agencies offer? Depending on the price, the services offered range from advising, to comprehensive, to outright illegal cheating. Some packaged examples:

1000-10,000Y (150-1400 USD) range - Advice on schools to apply to / coping and preparation with life in the US. English coaching, SAT coaching, and essay/written statement advising. Most innocent of services, but you would be surprised at how little some of these kids know considering they want to study overseas. Minimal english listening skills, can't speak at all, never left their city or hometown, doesn't know a thing about living by themselves nor any worldly knowledge.

100,000-300,000Y (15K-43K USD) range- Extensive school admissions details (non-public admission figures such as yearly race admittance ratios, trends in what to look for in applicants, etc). Coaching for SAT, 24/7 available advisors and tutors. Will have a PhD-level native/fluent english speaker to write your essays, personal statements. Can fake recommendation letters and extracurricular activities.

300,000Y-1,000,000Y+ (43K-140K+ USD) range - All of the above, with options to have a SAT test taker sit the test for you, with a guaranteed 1550+, 800 on the subject tests. Actual sitting Chinese professors or other professionals to write your recommendation letters. Will set you up with pseudo-internships or other extracurricular activities (working 10-20 days under a CEO/CFO, lab research assistant, bullshitted paper publication etc) in order to list on your resume, and to bring up at interviews. This is guaranteed to bear admittance to a top 20 US college or university. 

I believe there is also an option for guaranteed Ivy acceptance, but that is dependent on the school of choice and costs a lot more. If a student does not gain admittance, they can try again next year for 50% of the package price. I am unsure if transcripts are/can be also faked, but it is more than possible.

There are a surprising number of Chinese students that use these services. Most come from wealthy backgrounds, and some from modest means where mom and pop scrounged savings for 20 years, or sold the old family home. Many are the children of government officials (250k USD degree on a 10,000Y/month salary? lol). How much it costs in the end depends on the prestigiousness and competitiveness of the school, and how challenged the kid is.

But in the end, most do end up getting into a Western school, even if it's University of North Dakota or some other unimpressive name, as long as it's overseas.",2,1,154.79786090002293,college
What is the purpose of a Senior Seminar class?,"If you are in a major that requires a Senior Seminar class, then you will have to write a 20-40 page paper on a narrowed topic of your choice. It is not like a traditional college class that you have taken. It's very intensive and it's not about just writing 20-40 pages of facts. You have to come up with a thesis statement and make arguments and main points throughout the paper. My major is history and I had to take a senior seminar class and I couldn't handle it. I was accused of plagiarizing when I turned in my rough draft. Other people were having other issues with writing it as well. I understand that I plagiarized, but I don't understand what the issues were with other peoples' papers. If you cite everything correctly, put everything in your own words, and use proper grammar/spelling, then I don't know what more they want. I was supposed to graduate this weekend, but it's now been postponed because of this class. First of all, I'm not that interested in history. I wish that I had gone with something else. Secondly, I have high functioning autism aka Asperger's which means that I have ADD and problems with executive functioning. My advisor has come up with a new major for me which is Integrative Studies. This requires me to write a 15-20 page paper connecting the top 2 subjects that I have studied throughout college. Once I finish this paper, I could graduate by the end of the summer or the fall. I don't understand why they expect you to write a 30 page paper. Nobody wants to write that many pages. People just want their degrees and to be done with school. We've already written hundreds of papers throughout our academic careers. Why do they punish us like this once we get close to graduating?",19,3,157.90622895557846,college
Why do ivy league schools acceptance rate is so low?,"So, I've been thinking about how Yale and It's peers invest so much in corporate image.

Prof shut me down when I tried to discuss a grade on my paper,"I got a bad grade on a paper that was graded by the TA, and I completely disagree with her reasoning/comments. Especially since they go against the guidelines for writing the paper. Went to talk to my prof about it, ask him to look at the paper and he shut me down and said I have to talk to the TA. 

This is frustrating since I'm going to go to the TA, say I disagree, she is going to say that that's what she thinks the paper is worth and then I'm going to have to go back to my prof and talk to him about it again. This is going to make this whole ordeal last 3 weeks since the paper was handed back, as it has already been 2 weeks. 

What's super frustrating is that the TA isn't a grad student, she's in undergrad like me. I think I'm actually a year ahead of her. So she doesn't really have the experience to be grading papers for other undergrad students. ",4,2,215.28967802965255,college

Lessons learned from college.,"1. Most who go to college are not meant for it. Nearly every day in college there were those of us who struggled with most concepts to grasp, but there were always like 3 or 4 that shine. I'm not talking about geniuses, but really hardworking passionate people. These are the few college should be for. A place for these few to pursue their gift and later research the future in the field. The ones with true passion that live for what they are learning, not learning to live.

If you are riding on these 3 or 4 back to pass a class you need to do some serious soul searching on how much time and money you are wasting following the blazed trail of truly invested, passionate scholars of the industry.

2. Why did I not work first??? This one is huge. The answer to this is obviously the culture, but ... I really wished I worked before I went to school. Working gives you appreciation for your own time and how much student loan debt actually can be. This could also be a fire under your butt to pursue a degree harder in hopes of never having to work a less professional job again.

3. College is a business. College is not a church that hands out degrees and promises you a job in the end. College is a business that barters education for money. Before I went I wish I looked at the entire scope like a business transaction. When we are poor college students, we usually make the choices for the cheapest most valued lunch deal on campus when buying lunch or dinner. At the same time we expect it to fill our bellies and get the fulfill our needs.

I wish I paid more attention to how valuable one college was versus another or if college was going to give me enough value to have an ROI one day.",1,1,492.64736321483775,college
I do not want to waste 4-6 years of my life by going to college.,"That being said, 

I start college this fall. I turned 19 two months ago so I’m starting one year late due to some problems last year that I couldn’t control. I am having a lot of trouble on selecting a major. 

I always thought that I would want to be an English major (since my junior year of high school.) However, I came to an epiphany about 3 days ago that it’s hard to make a good amount of money with an English degree. 

Recently, majoring in marketing has caught my interest. However, I’ve heard that many people major in marketing and that the marketing industry has fierce competition. Recently, I’ve also thought about majoring in economics. I still do not know much about that degree though. 

My question to any readers is: What major should I pursue?

My interests so far are:

-Marketing
-Economics
-Law (problem with this is I don’t have money for law school)

I want a job that pays a decent amount of money and a job where I wouldn’t have to worry about struggling too hard to find a job after graduating. Feel free to suggest any other fields that I haven’t listed. ",45,3,600.4190298815043,college
"The longer I stay in college, the more I grow to loathe everything about it","I get A's in everything. Academic success is not my concern. But to be in college is practically torture. And everyone is so stupid including the professors when they aren't talking about their own research. They're practically specialists in their field but dumbasses in the real world. And I'm not even joking because I find people who get into trades smarter on the whole. Out of the 15 classes I've taken so far, maybe 3 had decent professors. Knowledgeable but can't convey ideas. That's exactly it. Why has 4/5 of all my courses been reading off the textbook and skipping lectures cause you can't teach? What the fuck am I paying for?  Everything else about college is also rotten. ROTTEN. Especially the way they rip you off shamelessly with their meal plans.

4.0 GPA Sophomore in High School Getting Burned Out Thinking About Not Going to College,"I'm a 4.0 GPA sophomore, and I've only taken a practice ACT, but I got a 31. I love learning, and just last year I had no doubts about going to college, but I now am having thoughts about not going at all or joining the military. 
It's not about the money, my parents have said that they'll pay for three years of tuition, and if I get scholarships then that'll cover the last year that I'm responsible for, I just am not sure I want to ""waste"" four years of my life in that manner. I'm sure that I'd love college, but I think that I can do great things without it. With that being so, I'd really only be going to college for the experience and the networking (meeting people and making connections for later in life), and I'm not sure if that's worth a quarter of a million dollars and four years of my life. I've talked to my parents about this, and they're supportive, but reserved about the idea, as they want me to be successful.
My feeling is that if you treat your whole life like a college education, you'll never have to go, so I'm taking entrepreneurship, video production, and newspaper classes and preparatory classes in high school as a way to get as much information as I can before I graduate. 
I'm not sure exactly what I'd do while I don't go to college, but I figure that this is the 21st century, and there are all of these startup and internet jobs that I could put my smarts toward getting. I'm also trying to see if I could my parents to let me use the money that they would put towards my tuition instead to let me use to do what I want with it (start a business, invest, travel). 
I know that this is my sophomore year, and a lot will change before senior year, but I feel like this is a sentiment that will stay, as I truly don't feel that college is a perfect fit for me. That being said, I do love the idea of rushing a fraternity, having the college experience, and getting to live four years of my life in an enclosed environment and getting to be my own person, however, I'm not sure it's something that I can commit that level of time to.

Worried about finding a good job after college,"So some of my classmates are bad at their majors (bad at Computer Science, physics, Economics, Math) and decide to pursue them anyway. I know that grade inflation is big today and present at my college so their getting a B in their classes is really worth a C. They won't succeed if they continue to do their majors because the job market is competitive, and there a plenty of people who can do better than them, and they grades are inflated so much so their grades mean nothing and they're not good at what they study. I know a few economics majors who falsely think they will definitely get rich by studying economics, but I think they won't succeed because the good jobs will be taken by those in IVy League colleges' students. The statistics majors I know can't program and programming is pretty necessary in statistics. The economics majors I know decided to pursue the economics major even though they don't want to be an investment banker and can't stand the 110 hours of work per week. I don't think there's many avaliable jobs besides investment banking/analyst-like/hedge-fund like jobs for economics majors and it's unprobabilistic that they'll get a job besides investment banking and if they do investment banking good luck on the 100 hour work week and banker 9am to 5am work ""day"". If you don't want to be an IB or analyst, majoring in econ is like useless right? The bio majors will end up not in medical school because they can't handle medical school and end up in labs getting paid like $40,000 per year after wasting so much money on college with all the student loans and debt. I'm pretty much in the same situation as them and I can't program, ain't a genius, didn't do extremely well on SATs and I feel like I won't get a good job. I'm not a phenomen writer either or talker. Am I doomed to get a low-paying job I don't like? It's like Karl Marx is right about the fact they we're all getting poorer even though we work harder and harder. I know some people who are majoring in social work majors, and those don't earn good money either or have marketable skills. I don't understand why people pick majors that are useless job wise. I know chem-majors who are really smart and should have picked Chemical Engineering because they're smart enough to do that but they ended up chem-majoring which compares second to none to Chemical Engineering and is less useful jobwise. They say they don't want to do chem, want to do something like IB which requires lots of econ knowledge after graduation but I doubt there's any other options besides teaching and chemistry for them after graduation because you only get to go to college once right?. I know physics majors who had every opportunity to choose the engineering path instead, and don't have the brains to become a physicist. I am not talking about how happy people will be if they pick a certain job or career. Why did these people even go to college if they're not competitive enough?",11,0,1226.1566571963192,college

My Full Experience At Pensacola Christian College Part 2,"The dorm life for me, as I stated before was rough. It was new for me, since I never been in a dorm in my life. I would soon learn that it takes time and patience to get used to it. So two of my roommates, who were seniors, were actually popular. Yes, they were well known thought out the school. And that's something I should've looked at, becuase I'm the kind of person who doesn't like a lot of attention. Anyway, I would soon learn that not everyone follows the rules. You see, music is a BIG thing at PCC. There's certain things we aren't allowed to listen to and certain things we are allowed to listen to. And to make sure that they actually montired music, there are no headphones allowed. And I literaly took these rules seriously. I left my mp3 and my headphones at home, and I'm thinking they follow the rules. But a few weeks later, one of the roomates brings an apple computer and installs it with speakers, and the next thing, he's just BLASTING it! And man, most of the music he listened to was way aganist the rules! But you know something, the rooms was right next to the ice room. So you know what that means? No one can hear it. They were smart and knew it all too well. And the other roomate was doing it as well! He installed speakers on his bed and jammed out to is music that was aganist the rules as well. So, I'm thinking, wow. I guess most people break the rules. And it turns out, most of the guys on the floor did. And no one cared. So, that's when I started to break the rules also. You can read more about it on my post. But I was like, wow. These guys are well known in the college, they have so much knowledge from the bible, and they break rules too? To me, it didn't make any sense. Anyway, another thing that was a big pet peeve, was sleeping. You see, since they were both ""Well known"", people just popped in. Yeah, even at night as well. And yeah, when I was sleeping as well. And to me, that was just so rude. They actually had no respect for people who were trying to sleep, espically people who had to go to work or to rest for a big test. And yes, I figured out that they were basically in charge of the dorm, and I had no final say whatsover. I tried to talk to them but they just didn't budge. I also DID try to move to another room, but It didn't work out. So, I stuck with it. Even my other roommate and I had frequent talks in private about how they don't give any consideration to us. But hey, that's how college life is. From sleeping to sharing the bathroom was a huge struggle. I'm not saying I don't like them, I do. In fact, we are good friends. But it's the other things I didn't like. It was just rude.

I pretty much explained a lot of things on my other post, so I won't put it on here. But I have a interesting stories that will blow your mind. And yes, I was there.

My friends and I were out of campus just to go somewhere to eat. Sometimes the food just gets too old. But yeah, as we were driving, one of my friends forgot his wallet. He was worried like crazy. Why, because he had ""Condoms"" in it. Yep, apprently this guy has sex with the college girls, and they are stirct about it. He found his wallet and didn't get in trouble, but seriously. He needs to be careful, because the moment he gets caught, all his hard work there would be a waste if he gets kicked out.

Oh yeah, there was a girl I liked brielfy, but she's just a baby, fresh out of high school. I also prefered girls around my age lol.

One thing I want to talk about is the ushers there. They recently posted an article about them, and explain how they take their job seriously and stuff like that. It also explains how they set a positive example for the service, which is not always the case. I had experiences where a usher just told me to sit at a spot coldly. Yes, they are professionals, but I feel most of them have favorites. Yeah, since they are made up RA's, they only talk to the popular crowd. Most RA's are popular, since they have a big role. I even saw an usher in one event just going back and talking to a hot spanish girl. But yeah, not all are like that. I knew one who was cool and had no problems with. But some of them just have a cold attitude. I think they get it from their cold bosses.

I had a situation I think I can describe as discrimation. In chapel, it was the last quarter of the semester, and I was sitting next to a white girl. And all that time, she never looked at me, she never spoke to me, and she only moved if I was getting into the seat. So, she couldn't talk to me, but she could talk to a girl, who was asian. Yeah, I could feel a lot of tention. And yes, I can personally say that PCC has rasicm inside. Yes. Even christians can discrimate.

I feel that the interantionals are more friendly, since they are from another country. In fact, I was friends with a lot of them. I felt that I could bond with them more than us Americans.

Oh yeah, the elevators. Everytime someone goes to the secnd floor, people always complain. And yeah, I had a guy get mad at me one day, while I was going to class. Honestly, I wanted to say that I pay to be here just as you. But then that would get into an argument, and I don't like to waste time arguing. But after a while, I just brush it off when I have to go to the second floor.


Yeah, I pretty much explained my experiences. But I want to share one last thing. It's how I was treated that lead me to withdraw from the college. You see, prior to going back, I was in a deep situation. So, I wrote a letter explaining everything. Fortunantly, they responded, but not in the manner that I wanted. I remember getting a call from student life, saying that someone wanted to speak to me. So, I went there and spoke to Dr.Ohman. He told me he read the letter and looked at my situation, but told me that there was nothing they could do. And he did it in a way where it was stone, cold hearted. I've seen him speak during a chapel service once, and thought he was this perosn who cared for the student body. Wrong. He's just there to enforce the rules. And that's what he was doing. Just sitting there in his office, him staring at me and looking at me with coldness, it didn't feel good. The ""love"" they always talk about wasn't anywhere near this man. I mean, if he told me in a more lighter way with understanding, then I would take that. But that wasn't the case. So, After that, I knew the college wasn't the place for me anymore. Aside from the fact that It's not accredited, most people really don't care. So I knew I had to leave. I actually stayed for a few more days, trying to work it out, but they stuck with their rules.

"Expensive college is lowering its cap from $2,000 to $1,000 while it costs a typical $37,616","So, I go to Mars Hill University and it costs a typical $37,616. As you can tell it is an expensive university and the amount that was allowed you to have on your bill that you did not have to pay was $2,000. So then they decided to lower that to $1,000. AND THEY DID THIS WITHOUT TELLING US. It just happened and they are just trying to sneak it past us. The university is not helping the students that have low income by making them pay $1,000 more out of nowhere. 

Also we have Work Study. That over a semester gives you $1,500 so that means we have to pay MORE then what we are supposed to anyway since we have to pay the bill at the BEGINNING of the semester.

If you feel like helping the students of this university then you can sign this petition: http://www.thepetitionsite.com/506/850/596/raise-the-cap/?taf_id=13515368&cid=fb_na#  or you can spread this message. We may be a small here at Mars Hill University, but we as students don't deserve this.


CLARIFICATION EDIT:

Reading through comments I realize that the problem that students have with this new policy is not entirely clear.
We are not complaining that the cap exists, or that it was lowered. There are two major factors that we feel are wrong with this new policy:

1. This new policy came out of nowhere. We were told about this policy a few weeks before we had to do early registration and because of this, in order to register for the next year people have to come up with $1,000 dollars in a few weeks, and with the price of the University this is not an easy achievement. 

2. This cap is lower then what most people earn over a semester which is $1,500. This money is through work study, goes to a students tuition, and you receive all of the money over the course of the semester. This means that with a $1,000 cap work study students have to pay more money towards their tuition then needed. 

We are not complaining about the fact that the cap exists, just the time frame in which it was implemented and also for those who have to now pay more then what they should.",5,2,1678.9797937703934,college
Reporting a vicious comment someone made on social media?,"So we have a Facebook group for our course. There is a lecturer, we'll call her M and people have been making some really nasty comments about her.

However today someone decides to post ""I vote we burn M at the stake because she's a little bitch!"" And 2 people liked it.

Of course everyone goes through it if they attend a college. . . I know.  Haha

I was just wondering if any of the professionals here could help.  

Some questions I have are:

How do I NOT look like a freshman.  (Because we all know some people who will make a fool of themselves)  How can I avoid the embaressment?

As a pre-med student, what could I be doing to prepare myself for the MCAT as early as my first term in college?

Money is always a nice thing right?  Do you have any tips for getting monies for undergrad?

What are some things I should avoid bringing to campus for move-in-day?  Also, some things I should FOR SURE bring?  What kind of things do you have in your dorm?

How do I get involved, it seems pretty scary, if you will...  I feel like I might be stuck in my dorm for a while trying to figure it all out.  Haha

Is there any general life advice you guys have as I begin my journey through adulthood and college?

Thanks guys, from an excited but stressed soon-to-be freshman. Any help would be great!  If you feel that I have missed some pretty important questions than please comment.   I'd like to soak up as much as I can before I start this journey.  :)

How to improve sophomore year,"College was a difficult transition for me. I moved 6 hours away from home, had a terrible roommate first semester, and found out I was rejected from an internship that I spent 1.5 years applying for (it was a multi-step process). I'm pursuing degrees in both psychology and information sciences. My GPA for first semester was a 3.55, which isn't terrible, though this semester my classes are more difficult, and my professors really aren't that great, so I'm a little bit worried about my GPA dropping after this semester, though it's too early right now to say if that'll happen or not. I also ended up not really getting involved in anything outside of schoolwork.

I want to improve sophomore year, and I'm wondering if you guys can give me any advice. I want to get into grad school, and I know I need to start making myself look competitive now. It's too late to apply for a different internship this summer, so I'll just be going home to likely get just a generic job (retail or restaurant, etc.) to save up some money for the next semester. I want to get involved in more clubs, but whenever I went to club meetings this past year, I found that it was hard to establish myself as an individual. I also want to get a job during the year (well, need to, since I'll be living off-campus and need to have money for groceries, rent, etc.). So, I want to get a job, join clubs, boost my resume, etc., while also still making good grades. I'm also a runner, so I need to leave in time for that as well. I don't know how to do all of this without overextending myself, but I know I need to include more activities outside of school for my resume while also still maintaining good grades.

How do I manage all of this? Any advice? ",3,0,2026.4230923815046,college

The Truth about Affirmative Action- an Op Ed,"Affirmative Action. It's controversial, and continues to rise in popularity with the rapid decrease in college acceptance rates. According to Wikipedia, Affirmative Action is ""the impetus is to redress the disadvantages associated with overt historical discrimination."" 

""African-American applicants receive the equivalent of 230 extra SAT points (on a 1600-point scale), and being Hispanic is worth an additional 185 SAT points. Asian-American applicants face a loss equivalent to 50 SAT points."" (Chung & Espenshade, 2005)

The statistics above make one thing fairly obvious for sure, and that is Affirmative Action is blatantly racist. Affirmative Action assumes that all African American or Hispanic applicants are underprivileged and belong to families with incomes below the poverty line, and did not have the same opportunities as their peers. This does not take into account individual hardships that may not be restricted to a person's race. Additionally, this undermines any hardships faced by an Asian or a White applicant. Affirmative Action implies that there are no Asian or White families that could possibly be under the poverty line. Of course, all White and Asian people are rich and live in good crime-free neighborhoods. And also, of course there are no well-off African Americans or Hispanics besides Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Lopez, right?  

It is not unheard of for an Asian student with excellent credentials to be rejected from the same university that would accept a non-Asian candidate with the same or similar credentials. Due to Affirmative Action policies, thousands of Asian and White applicants get turned away from schools which they are qualified or even over-qualified for, based on an unsaid quota. As a result, less qualified students are given admission determined by their race, and not their merit. Yes, competitive colleges are looking for students that have good credentials in extracurriculars as well, but this does not mean that Asian and White students lack these traits. This also does not mean that Hispanic and African American students are necessarily well-rounded.

Arguments that the Asian culture enforces an academic oriented focus on children does not invalidate the fact that these Asian students still had to devote hard work into preparing themselves for college. It is unfair that their credentials are often chalked up to simply ""being Asian."" On the other hand, Affirmative Action is also offensive to African American or Hispanic students at competitive institutions. An unwanted bias is created that these students were admitted to the university based solely on Affirmative Action. There is a negative stigma that these students had lower SAT scores or qualifications than their peers, and this often is not the case, and is untrue for many African American or Hispanic students that have credentials on par of those of their Asian or White counterparts. Affirmative Action should be based on an individual's personal experiences and family income level, not on their race, which beyond their control.

Affirmative Action has greater consequences than most people realize. Individuals that attend elite institutions are exposed to far more opportunities than students at other colleges. For example, students at Ivy League universities have more access to highly coveted positions due to connections and the name brand of the institution. This is not to say that students at other colleges do not have these opportunities, but the number of wealthy and successful alumni of each elite institution compared to that of other colleges speaks for itself. Society's expectations of the graduates of elite colleges are much higher, and thus, are likely to be given more responsibility. Can you imagine if this responsibility were to fall into the hands of an under-qualified applicant, while someone who should have been in their place could be contributing more to society, but is unable to do so due to the ""virtues"" Affirmative Action?

A final word for the advocates of Affirmative Action. Should we allow some grace for Asians in the Olympics? After all, isn't it popularly conceived that they are too busy studying Math to play sports, and maybe a 5 second head-start in the 400 meter wouldn't be so bad. This is essentially the same effect that Affirmative Action is trying to achieve. Is Eminem's fame and success due to an Affirmative Action policy in the rap music industry? Didn't think so.",20,3,2333.058786825949,college

What recourse do I have against my Professor,"Recourse against my professor/univeristy?

I am a SUNY university student. I took a very intuitive class that required countless hours of studying. I just did miserably. Before the final exam our professor emailed our grades for each assignment. 

I emailed him back asking if it was possible for me to pass his course as I have had a difficult time. 

He responded bluntly. No. He said you it would be **impossible** for you to pass my class. He noted that even if I got a 100 on the last exam I would fall .9 pts short of passing. 

He went on to say that he recommened me focusing my attention on my other clsases, basically tell me to not waste my time taking his exam.

I took his advice. 

A week after the test he sent an email out to our class saying he decided to **drop our lowest 4 grades** on a particular daily assignment!

Conceivably, I could have passed this course -- and not even needed a 100 on the exam.

**TL;DR Teacher told me I could not pass class, focus on my other classes. He ended up dropping 4 of our lowest grades which would have made it conceivable I could have realistically passed**

[META] PSA to /r/college,"Stop complaining. Stop acting like college is the hardest thing anyone's ever done. Stop looking for pity.

I got a B in class, mommy isn't here to pick out my clothes, I'm thinking about dropping out/killing myself..."" Know what? Actually, you DO deserve that. You don't want to put in the work? You want to sleep and party your way through college? Damn right you deserve it. And as for the other ""sky is falling, college-is-soooo-tough :'("" type of topic? That's idiotic as well. You're a grown ass man or woman. Act like one. Be a little forward thinking and realize that the world doesn't revolve around you and that B you got in Basket Weaving 101 doesn't really matter in the long run.

Maybe it's just because I did my time in the military before going to college and have a different outlook on what's hard and what's fair. Maybe it's just because I actually put in the time and effort in school. Who knows. But I have no sympathy for people who whine and slack off but expect a shoulder to cry on. I have buddies overseas right now who would love to be in college right now.

I'm not saying it's wrong to post about stressing about finals during finals week. We're all going through that. I'm not saying it's wrong to freely admit that you messed up and want advice on how to salvage the situation. That's what this sub is for. It is wrong to use this sub to vent, rage, and complain about things that are squarely on your shoulders.

What should I major in?,"Hi,
I am a community college student taking general studies as a major.
I plan to transfer into a university next Fall. However, I am confused on what else to major in if things does not work out.
I regret majoring in my backup plan first rather than doing my general ed's because now I hate computer science. 
I thought I had liked coding. I had goals to create a social media app but, that didn't work out as you can see. I knew if I couldn't enjoy my classes what made me think that I would enjoy developing a new social media app and a lot of time and money goes into that. I did however, enjoy creating websites when I was in high school. I took a few web development classes. But after, awhile I started looking at everyone's else's work and they were so much more better than mines. I guess, I got discouraged also, because the fact that I found it difficult when it came to coding the HTML. Even though, it was only the basics and I felt stupid for that. I did try other majors as well such as art and music my main two passions but, they didn't work out and also, the jobs doesn't pay well unless you know someone from a good company and have a killer portfolio.
I thought about going into the medical field for a while but, I don't have the brains for that. I don't make straight A's and never have. It's difficult for me to do so.
I don't know what else to do! I don't want to go back into computer science because I can't see myself doing that as a career.
My other options aren't that great. I don't want to work retail for the rest of my life. If I do find a job. 
What should I do? I have been to technical college first and then community college. There are no trade schools where I live.
I'm just lost as to what to do next.
I don't even have mentors around my area or at my school to help.
I know at least two things about myself: I am not cut out for the medical field or for the STEM field like I thought I was going to be.
What helped you figure out what you wanted to do?
I'm only 20 years old and I'm trying to at least figure out a part of my life. 
Thanks for the advice!

Couple questions,"So hey, Im actually from the Netherlands but I really want to go to college in america, since I heard they throw parties like in the movies. Also I want to play a sport there like american football or basketball, so probably I need to go to a bad football college cause in the Netherlands we dont play football so I dont expect me being that good. But now the questions, my first one is at what age do you go to collage? In Netherlands it is 16 but I heard it was like 18 in America. Second: Would it be able for me to play football at some bad football college? Or maybe basketball? Or are they all quite good? Thirth: are the stories i hear true? Are college parties awesome? Is college just like in the serie blue mountain state (but with classes)? Maybe I have a couple more questions i'll put them down below. ",36,0,1333.476634048171,college

Welcome Back Weekend,"With the spring semester coming up right around the corner, even a week for some schools, I'm sure everyone is taking to their group messages filled with their college cliques. And in them they're planning out the welcome back weekend and syllabus week madness that will take place once everyone is back on campus. 

Personally, my friends are making a very classy move for our week back in the dormitory halls... ever clear and burnies. Wether it's jungle juice or ripping shots, it's happening and the results will be great... that is until the next morning.

Wrong academic counseling - grounds to sue?,"I'm going to a community college in CA and started seeing an academic counselor during my second semester. I asked him to set up my classes so that I would transfer out with an AST (associate's transfer degree). The counselor told me that I could follow the IGETC or BREADTH path and since I never intended to go to a UC but a CalState plus the fact that for my major I would have had to take more math classes with the IGETC, I chose to go with BREADTH. I have taken a couple of extra classes to fulfill the requirements for the AST and could have transferred a while ago had I opted not to go for the transfer degree. So last week I saw my counselor to sign the paperwork to graduate after this fall semester. He gave me the documents, I signed them and he then sent me on my way to admission and records to file it to my documents. Later on that day I get a phone call from an admission clerk, stating that my petition to graduate was declined as only the IGETC fulfills the requirements to get the AST. I have invested time off of work, money, time I could have transferred earlier etc. to get my AST and it seems like following the academic counseling I have been receiving made a lot of the work, effort, time and money worthless. My question: Do I have grounds to sue for compensation? Could they excempt me from the requirements and give me the AST due to the circumstances? ",10,1,1469.873671085208,college

Debating joining a frat? From what I hear it sounds like a pretty poor experience if it weren't for the party access. Is it still possible to go to plenty of parties (2-3 a week if you were so inclined) while not being a member of a university?,"It sounds like exclusive access into the best parties comes from either knowing someone at a frat or actually being a member at one. I've read some pretty terrible things about frats and living there (dress codes, racism, sexism, dirty house, unable to sleep) but going to lots of parties is definitely on my agenda. I'm a former nerd and really need a way to keep socializing. 

&nbsp;

I've made extraordinary improvements upon my life, going from jerking off twice a day to finally losing my virginity (I say finally even though I'm not a legal adult). 

&nbsp;

So say I just so happened to be  accepted to a university with top 5 of the ""best party scenes in the country"" according to niche,  would being a member of a fraternity drastically increase the number of parties I would be able to attend, maybe at least 1 a week?

Textbooks - Why do professors insist on using the latest textbook?,"Why do professors insist on assigning the latest textbook in classes where the information rarely changes. Math, Chemistry/Science in general, and old Literature for example. The old editions 99% of the time have the same __exact__ information and won't change in the near future. These old editions also come in at 10-20% of the cost most of the time and that is the difference of spending $150 per semester or $1500 per semester. Most of the time I can't even get older editions because there is mandatory online content for $10 less ( so its $275 for the book new and with online content, and $265 if you just want the online content) the old editions will come in at $15-$50 so there is no incentive to be frugal and get the older edition.

Will we expect to see a change in the near future with this? What are the professors/universities getting in return for assigning these books? Are they getting funding for using the latest editions? I can only assume they are getting some sort of perks because why else would you want to take around $1000 out of each students pocket and set it on fire each semester?

Parents will not pay for school,"So I am expected to go to Otis this Spring Semester after applying in the Summer of 2014.

Getting Through College Without Loans. Pro Tips!,"Howdy,

This is a big wall of text. I am very thorough.

I received my BBA/MBA in Finance this week (that's a masters level). I am 23 years old. My family made over $200k a year every year that I attended school and I was paying $700 a semester for grad level classes.  I am here to provide advice and tips on how to get through college with no debt!

DISCLAIMER: You don't have to do everything and if you haven't done something, don't worry about it. Start where you are. Every little thing makes a difference.

**What to do in High School**

* **AP**

I attended a public high school. I took a bunch of AP classes. Every class was free and my AP tests were subsidized. I passed every AP test (some with better grades than others!). Going into college I had 25 credit hours. If you do well in high school, you will be rewarded later on.

* **CLEP Tests**

AP isn't even the best way to get credits. [CLEP tests](http://clep.collegeboard.org/) are by far the easiest way to receive college credit for classes. Basically, this is a program that allows you to test out of classes and receive college credit without taking the classes. [They have 33 exams in 5 subject areas.](http://clep.collegeboard.org/exam) If you are serious about your college education, you should be serious about CLEP. College Algebra can be studies online via dozens of resources [\(Khan academy\)](https://www.khanacademy.org/) for free! The exams cost $80 and will give you 3 credit hours if you pass. That's about $27 a credit hour.

Look at it this way... If you are determined enough to go to college, you should be determined enough to study on your own. If you can study on your own and push yourself, you can get rid of the first year of college for under $1,000 and never have to attend a pointless class. This should be your starting point.

* **Dual Credit**

Don't forget about dual credit classes! These are classes which count both for college and high school at the same time. The most beautiful part of these classes is that most are pass/fail oriented. This means that if you make a C or an A, there is no difference if you are already accepted into college (check grade requirements at the college you are transferring to! There is no guarantee this works for everywhere). Not every high school offers these, but they are great if you have them near you.

*If you take these three routes seriously in only your senior year and/or the summer before you begin college, there is no reason you should not skip a semester! Keep in mind that you should focus on the universities you want to go to. Don't take anything that will not count toward your degree plan in college.*

**Choosing a University**

Pro tip: Do not go to an out of state college. Your in state college is just as good unless you are going to an Ivy League school or technical school for a specific degree.

* **Community College Route**

Community college is a great place to start. Everyone I know knocks on them, but they are cheap and easy. Whenever you graduate from your 4 year school the name on the diploma isn't a community college. They are cheaper than any other school as well.

Once you finish your 2 year degree, transfer to a 4 year public college nearby and graduate with a full degree. 2 year degrees are great if you don't know what you want to do. Most freshmen don't know what they want to do. [80% of students will change their major at least once while in college.](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage+of+students+who+change+major&rlz=1C1LENN_enUS495US495&oq=percentage+of+students+who+change+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.7340j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8) What most people don't realize is that people get into debt and graduate in 5-6 years instead of 4 years because of changing their major and/or transferring. Nothing feels worse than taking a class that you did not need that you did not enjoy and spending lots of money doing it.

* **4 Year Public Route**

If you can get into a 4 year university right from the start, you might want to do that! There is only one reason to attend a 4 year university over community college right out of high school: scholarships.

The first thing you need to realize about 4 year public institutions is that there are deadlines... lots of deadlines. The university does not make exceptions. If you apply for scholarships early there is a decent chance that you will be able to receive them. Some scholarships will last your entire 4 years and are renewed every year. You are only eligible to receive them upon entering university.

* **4 Year Private Route**

This might surprise you but this is the route that I took. Annual expenses were estimated at $32K a year, but I paid $1.5K. There are numerous scholarships available at these types of universities. You will receive a large amount for grades that is guaranteed at most (10-15K is average next year). Those scholarships last the entire 4 years. You are also eligible to receive extra scholarships for a slew of reasons. Eagle scouts, religious, race/ethnicity, first generation... I am not lying when I say the list goes on and on.

You may disagree with me, but this is Reddit so who cares! 4 Year Private Colleges that charge you $25K+ a year are a scam. Your education does not cost that much. They are paying for more administration, rampant inflationary spending, and unnecessary things that you probably won't even take advantage of. College isn't a vacation or an experience. College is a place that you go to learn. The price of education is rising because we are moving away from learning and moving toward an experience. You have to ask yourself... is the experience of this college worth $100,000? Probably not.

The average debt of a student who graduates from my university is $26K. Don't be those people.

**How To Get MONEY!**

To start this process you need to fill out a [FAFSA](https://fafsa.ed.gov/). This is the US governments way to ensure your income is what you say it is and see if you need money. You are ineligible for financial aid until you fill this out.

You might want to [google financial aid FAQ](http://www.finaid.org/questions/faq.phtml) for simple questions?

Always apply for financial aid. My roommate received $1,000 just for filling out his FAFSA at the local community college he attends. If you are need based, you will receive thousands of dollars more!

You should go talk to a financial aid counselor during your application process. Don't wait. They should be happy to assist you and talk to you about potential aid. Every university is different and every place has their own scholarships. Ask about anything that makes you unique. Do not take no for an answer. I was told that there was nothing available 6 times before I received over $35K in a grant that they failed to mention to me. Determination is key. Don't be belligerent or demand aid, but keep asking at all times of the year.

The financial aid system is just that, a system. They have specific deadlines that you probably don't know about. Between a quarter and halfway through each semester they will receive a large sum of money back from the government. Basically, some money is returned to the government every semester and then redistributed based on certain criteria. That means that if you go into the office on the right day, there will be hundreds of thousands of dollars that just entered their account that they need to disperse to students. You might get lucky for no other reason.

[Visit one of these websites. They are your states higher education agency.](http://www.schev.edu/highered/stateeducationagencies.asp) These agencies will have information on grants and loans that are guaranteed to you based on criteria. In Texas there was a grant in which if you graduated in 4 years you would receive an extra $25,000 in financial aid. At certain public universities less than 4% of students took part in it. Keep in mind, this was a 0% interest loan if you failed to meet the criteria. People were passing up a no interest loan because they simply did not know!

**Government AID**

This section is going to make many users cringe, but you need to know it anyways.

If you can [become an independent](http://www.fastweb.com/financial-aid/articles/699-fafsa-and-the-independent-student), you can receive thousands of dollars extra in financial aid and government assistance for housing and living expenses.

Independents who are attending university are entitled to food stamps, section 8 housing, and medicaid. That means that your food, housing, and health insurance are all covered for free.

Not only do you get that stuff for free, but you will also almost assuredly receive more financial aid. Because financial aid is need based, an independent with no job or a minimum wage job will receive more government assistance than someone whose parent's incomes are considered. In this instance, it pays to be poor.

***Cringeworthy example***: I am 20 years old and my parents make too much for me to get scholarships, but they don't want to pay for my college. I can find anyone I know and get legally married to that person (maybe a roommate?) in December. I am now legally independent. The following year I will be eligible for extra financial aid and welfare. This is especially useful if I am currently unemployed.

Many people will be upset about this example. I am extremely upset that this is possible. Government reform needs to happen. However, it is 100% legal and will save you thousands of dollars if you are in need. If student loans are piling up, DO IT!


**TLDR**

Earn credits before college from AP and CLEP

Community College>everything else (not counting possible scholarships)

Apply for financial aid and work hard at the process

Don't be shy to get government assistance if you are an independent. You deserve it and pay for it in your taxes.

HS Senior(Not doing well),"I'm a high school senior, well, at least that's what I'm considered. I've blew off the majority of high school(I probably got an attendance of 60%) and my GPA is probably 1.0 overall. BUT, here's the thing. I got a sort of 'redo' if you will with going to an alternative school(I can't explain in detail or else I risk divulging personal info) I have the chance of graduating on time as well as bringing my GPA up to an acceptable level. I've also been told my highschool teachers that I write on a college graduate level. 

I horribly failed and barely attended the first 3 years of highschool. my freshmen year attendance was 40%. my sophmore year I pulled together with MUCH better attendance and grades but I ultimately stopped going to school near the end of the year and I fucked myself, bad(I was passing all my classes, but that didn't matter I didn't get the credits for the classes because I missed the finals). Junior year I started going to the alternative school, I started off strong(like I always do) but once again fell with my irresponsibility with drugs and friends. Now it's my last year, with the help of the alternative school my GPA is probably 2.75, right now and my attendance is doing better, too. 

What do y'all think my chances are of applying to a good college and getting accepted with those credentials?

TL;DR. I'm an irresponsible lazy drug addict with great capabilities and I really want to go to college, despite my actions. What are my chances?

In the small essay I talk alot about my health, the reason for this is because I got a knee injury that has affected my health and confidence for a while now. I am bullied alot and excercize gives me confidence.

College

Why am I going to college?


I feel like I am going to college because I HAVE to, just like school, it is a requirement society ponders upon me, or at least my parents make me believe it is that way. I have received an education that systematically prepared me for a higher level education. Instead of thinking critically, I learned formulas and memorized a set of rules to do something. Consequently, I have learned the ways of someone who listens, not someone who speaks. What I mean by this is that I have learned to follow rules, and not create them. But,  I want to go to college to learn and DISCOVER new things,  because it is a place where different minds that come from different backgrounds get together to create the ideas for the next generation. I don’t want to go to college because my parents or society says it is a NEED. I want to go to college to increase my experiences in order to create a more enjoyable ‘memory album’ I can look back to. College should not only be a place where you discover yourself and learn the stories of the people you meet there, but also a place to challenge yourself physically and mentally. However, if you cannot enjoy the challenge or do your best, it feels like a burden that becomes a need one must complete. 


As of right now I do not have a schedule to follow, my body is weak, and my mind is tired. I am tired of overthinking and of not having a positive influence or any reason for me to complete my dreams. All of this because I am distracted by too many pleasures that relax me to the point where a challenge would just create stress. Here is where sports come in, if I am able to do something for myself that influences my thoughts and physic, and then I am able to feel confident.  In other words, when I  exercise, it is a time of thinking and of confidence. I know what I am doing, and I am challenging my body in a healthy way to become stronger and ready for what is to come. Consequently, my body learns to be healthy; If my body wants to be healthy and feels strong, it challenges my mind to do the same thing. My mind automatically creates a scenario where my health is the priority. And that follows the idea that ‘a healthy body has a healthy mind’. With all of this in mind, my life becomes organized. 


A rested and strong body, a confident and awake mind create an unstoppable person that wishes to just enjoy life’s simplest pleasures, knowledge. If I am strong and smart, what is left to do? I have tamed myself, and by doing so, I am ready for anything. For college, for a job, for a relationship and for any challenge that is to come. No matter how bad a situation is, if I know that I am healthy mentally and physically, nothing can go wrong. Nothing can make me feel down because the only thing  that matters on my personal matters is my health. I might fail an exam, I might lose a loved one, I might lose a bet, or maybe just have a day that follows with many unlucky events, but if I know I am healthy, then what can stop me? Confidence comes from knowing that nothing can go wrong, and that thought alone creates a person, no….a man, that can do whatever he enjoys and wants to accomplish. Because no matter how many times he fails a challenge, he will get up knowing that eventually he will reach success on what he thinks is important. 


I am not in a hurry to graduate, there is no NEED to do so. And I am grateful to be in the position where I can decide my future based on what I enjoy. I can therefore, choose a job or as I think, a challenge, that I can enjoy. But before everything, I must improve my health. ",3,0,2258.430985900023,college
Do I even have a chance?,"I've done a bit of research and found out that this subreddit typically doesn't like these kind of posts, but I'm really worried right now and I didn't know who else to ask.

I'm coming up on my senior year of high school and I have this horrible nagging doubt in the back of my mind that I'm not going to be accepted into any good colleges. The main reason is because of how crappy my high school profile must look so far. I've gone to a horribly underdeveloped private school for all three years and, as such, I've had no opportunities for honors/AP courses or extracurricular activities. Luckily, I'm actually going to the public high school next year, but my counselor was only able to fit me in to one AP course. I have a 4.0 and got a decent score on the ACT, but I'm still really nervous about the lack of academic rigor and extracurriculars.

Do I have even the slightest chance of being accepted to a good school? I'm not looking to go to an Ivy or anything, because I know that I have no chance in hell of getting in to one of them. I'm looking more towards schools like Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis.

TL;DR No AP courses or extracurriculars available in three years of high school, tripping out about being able to go to a good school after graduating. Help pls? :(",20,0,2286.172212751875,college

College panic moment,"Hey r/college,
I've had a bit of a panic moment regarding college and my application options. Up to now, I was convinced I wanted to apply to a certain small liberal arts college that is well respected academically. Recenty I've been having second thoughts about location, name recognition (although I guess that's kind of a shallow consideration), and academics. 

I'd like to major in either physics or mathematics, and go on to a higher degree in one of those fields.

As for the school, I'm looking for urban or suburan, small-midsize, well known, and good academics.

I have a 95+ GPA and my SATs were 700 math, 690 reading, and 620 writing, fantastic recommendations and good extracurriculars. I like the idea of a selective school, but I don't know if I have the numbers for it.

Does college ever get harder?,"Hey all, I don’t want this to come off as arrogant or overconfident because I know a lot of people really have to grind out college but....for me I’ve always found it to be remarkably easy. I started college when I was 19 aiming for a Political Science degree. The classes were so easy that after a year and a half I more or less lost interest , stopped attending class, and flunked out (I was also having some pretty serious health problems at the time). The biggest problems I had were that I felt like I wasn’t being rewarded for effort (whether I put a lot of time, thought, and research into a paper or just shat something out the night before it was due I still got an A) and I felt like I wasn’t learning anything, in fact I often found myself catching the professor making mistakes. After flunking out I took a few years to get my health problems sorted out, got married, and at the behest of my wife decided to return to college, tho I switched to a different campus and opted for an Entrepreneurship degree with an Innovation/Computer Science minor. So far I’ve found that while I am now at least learning things in some of my classes, I can still steamroll over most assignments with minimal effort and get an A. I’ve even taken some upper division courses now, and have noticed no difference. Is this normal?

Living with females,"During my freshman year of college I have made many friends living in the dorms, but for next year I've decided to live off campus. Originally I was going to get a house with my male friends, but our plan fell through. After that I was asked to live with 3 girls as they needed one more roommate. After some consideration, I decided to sign the contract and pay the deposit.

The house itself is pretty spacious for the price we are paying, with four separate bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, living room, dining room, and basement. One of the main selling points for me was that since I was the only male, the girls would live in the three upstairs bedrooms, and I would get the master bedroom on the main floor with my own bathroom connected.

As for the girls, they all seem pretty focused on their education and sports, with the occasional party thrown in. I've known them all for awhile and they all seem alright, but I am well aware that there will be the occasional drama to deal with and I signed the contract well aware of this. To some guys this must be like a dream come true, but I have absolutely no intentions of having any kind of relationship with these girls outside of just being a friend and a good roommate. 

My family consists of my brother, dad, and mother, so I've never really experienced living in a female dominated house, and I really have no idea what to expect. 

So I guess I just wanted to ask some of the guys (if any) who lived/live with multiple girls in or outside of college if theres anything that I should know about living with mostly females.

Dorm Drama (Please dear God help),"I am a freshman at a state university. My classes are going amazingly, I love both my majors, and I have made a lot of friends, both close and casual.

My major issue here is that I live in a dorm of only high-achieving people in the business school (scholarship program perk). They are all very similar and there's a group of them that absolutely loves drama. My roommates are in that group, and, even though I really like and get along well with my roommates, I would rather not deal with the group dynamic that they're a part of.

I'm friends with the majority of people in their group (close with about four out of seven and friends with about six out of seven), and yet they still exclude myself and my friends. As I said, I have plenty of other friends and barely even want to be included here. I just can't get over the very obvious and purposeful exclusion. It's borderline bullying. Last night, one of the girls said something decidedly mean about my friends essentially right in front of me (she didn't know I was there, but she didn't care to check either). She said it to two people that I am friends with and neither said a word of protest (one of then comforted me later though). 

I do not understand their mentality at all. I get that some people won't like other people and that friend groups are natural. What I can't stand is the overt superiority complex. I would rather not exist to them at all if that's how they're going to treat me when I'm not around.

Family Dilemma,"***Friday, July 27, 2018 @ 10PM***

Hey there, to whomever may read this.

My name is Joshua, I was born and raised in Orange County, California and attended high school there, and I'm going into my junior year (second year) in college at San Francisco State University. I'm currently double majoring in both Political Science and Environmental Studies (concentrating in the Urban Environment). I'm also currently in a very difficult dilemma and I would love some other peoples' thoughts on the matter.

As a first year college student in the Fall of 2017, I was excited, nervous, and very intrigued on beginning my college career, and how it would begin. However, throughout the year, I discovered that it was overwhelming and more then I thought I could handle, but I was still having the time of my life. Never had I had so much freedom, so many choices, and so many opportunities to be able to do whatever I wanted.

During my first year in college, I've met my first boyfriend (and we're 10 months strong and counting), I interned for a mayoral campaign for the 2018 Mayoral Special Election for San Francisco (Mark Leno), I began the footwork on re-establishing the SFSU College Democrats since it had become inactive, I met many new people and gained new friendships in classes and extracurricular activities, I've applied (and sadly failed) for multiple positions and jobs throughout the SF area, I participated in resident student government to make living in the dorms a bit more fun, and done much more.

The problem with doing all of those things, is that I slacked on my college work and my grades slipped to being B's and C's, which was drastically different from my streak of A's and B's throughout my high school career. I know that they were slipping and I didn't like that they were, but I was having so much fun from doing those other things, that I thought that it was worth it, and it was necessary to involve myself in those things in order to get that 'full college experience'.

**Enter Mom.**

Throughout my life, my mom has always been the one who has pushed me to do better and move forward. As a single parent, it was necessary for her to know that her sons could support themselves and have the ability to be independent men when they grew up. Because of her actions, it was pushed me to become the determined, independent, and strong-willed person that I am today. I have strong beliefs, opinions, and I am feisty when I need to be to stand my ground. 

However, on that same note, my mom can be harsh when it comes to the reality that I don't meet her expectations, or when I fall behind on my grades. So, growing up, I was also afraid of that possibility of not meeting her expectations or what she wanted for me. At the same time, I knew that she only pushed me so hard because she wanted me to be able to take care of myself later on down the road.

**Enter Today.**

Today is a day that I will not forget. It started by my mom asking for my grades for the Spring 2018 semester, which I had failed to send to her in the past. I instantly knew that it wouldn't end well because I knew that she wasn't going to like what she saw, which was a 2.4 GPA, as well as a 3.3 GPA for summer school. She read them and asked me to come downstairs to talk about it, which completely filled my entire body with anxiety and regret for my lack of having acceptable grades.

It began as she was saying that I let her down and that she doesn't believe that this is my best work, and that's 100% true and I accept that completely. She also mentioned that maybe I had set myself a new path and created new priorities that weren't getting an education, as well as the fact that me not getting good grades after I said I would, was a slap to her face and a ""fuck you"", all of which I couldn't disagree more with.

Moving to college was truly an insane experience, both exciting and incredibly difficult. The workload is much heavier, the expected responsibility is much more than high school, and your work habits must be impeccable if you want good grades in your courses. This was also a massive culture shock and shift from home. From living in a chill bedroom community, where most people are Caucasian and conservative, to a massive and flashy metropolis, where people are all different colors and have crazy ideas and open minds. It was an amazing shift, but difficult nonetheless.

Dealing with this, as well as the fact that I didn't know anyone in San Francisco, was very mind-boggling and difficult to deal with as a new college student, as I imagine it is for everyone else. I would also say that my mom doesn't really know what it's like, since she went to school just a few miles from her parent's home, and she doesn't understand that shock.

What she mentioned next, is what truly broke my soul and heart, and that although she said we could talk about it with my dad and my brother, that she wants me to come back home after the Fall 2018 semester at SFSU, leaving not only my boyfriend of almost a year behind, but also all of the friendships I've created, the clubs that I want to return to and create, the experience that I've gained from college, and the knowledge and familiarity that I've obtained from both SF state and the city of San Francisco. She mentioned the possibility of me going to colleges near home, because she doesn't want to pay for me to get mediocre grades for $25,000 a year in San Francisco, when I can do it for $7,000 at home. But I went to San Francisco for the reason that I wanted to get out of this place and experience the world in a different part of California.

Just thinking about leaving behind my boyfriend, broke me and I just couldn't keep back the tears and sobs. It destroyed part of me thinking about having to sit at home, knowing that my boyfriend is 400+ miles away from me, and there was nothing that I could do about it, potentially causing the end of our amazing relationship. I cried a lot today, more than I have for a really long time, because I know that what I want to do, is exactly what I'm doing in San Francisco and at San Francisco State University, and to think that I can lose it all because of a few just average grade transcripts, just made me feel the shittiest and hopeless I've felt in a long time.

**Enter Reddit.**

I didn't know what to do after this happened, so I just decided that I would write this and see if anyone has any advice or feedback about the situation that I'm in. I'm just sitting in my bedroom, feeling numb and listening to music, and I don't know what to do. My dad and brother are coming over on Sunday and we're going to have a family discussion on what my mom thinks I should do, which I think is better because then everyone has a say in what they think, but I'm still terrified at the possibility of next semester being the last semester at SFSU.

Anywho, thank you if you read all of this to the end, and thanks even more to those who reply.

My Best,

How to make teacher understand that student of the month is a really bad idea?,"The last time I had a student of the month award, I was at primary school. Then there were no more such award, thanks to sound adults for that. Then arrived college which is in a whole other location that I had my lower education at. A different location with different teachers and different thinking. Yet students here are adults now or they will be way before the end of the program. This wasn't a problem until a teacher and another student ganged up on me saying I should be student of the month. I cringed and uneasily diverted the conversation. By the way, this award is concretized by having your picture and your name on the awards wall which you see when walking through the main entrance.

There's no way I'm gonna let myself be patronized like that, but I don't want to make things worst as I've seen things go south really quickly before. That teacher is not especially friendly. In my 3 months here, I've seen badly motivated students told to get the fuck out and come back when they get their motivation back by this same teacher. I feel like I'm walking on a minefield.

I'm not gonna talk to other teachers about it like a fucking child to his mother. I am going to confront this teacher, but I want to do it properly. Help me please. What is the right way to do?",8,1,472.05227062224515,college
"Embarrassed by the college I go to, should I drop out?","So I initially went to a state flagship after transferring from a CC with a 4.0 GPA and dropped out in the middle of the semester due to depression and a stressful part time job. After some recovery, I decided to enroll at a private school near my home, I got some scholarships and total cost went down to 16k, which is still expensive. But, the thought of going back to a state school with big lecture halls made it seem worthwhile at the time.

Now that I finished the semester with all A's, I feel like my school is just a scam. It is not even ranked, it has an acceptance rate over 60%, and no decent athletic centers. Some classes we just sat and did nothing or made videos in a writing class. Even many people in the state don't know about this school or look down on me when I say I go there (what I feel). 

Also, because I commute and my school does not have any clubs/activities since half of the people in this school are freshman (1 in 3 transfers out), I do not have friends.

I am a second year junior and not sure what to do, I do not want my a degree from this school, but I feel like I already transferred a lot and it will look bad when I apply to grad school. On the other hand, I am really unhappy and embarrassed to go here.

Please help.

scared to go to college,"okay so I am fresh off the grill from high school (im talking i got my diploma a week ago). Up till graduation, i hadn't planned on going to college because i didn't know what i wanted at all and just didn't feel like paying thousands for an education i wasn't invested in. but this past week, i have been thinking more and more and i kinda want to go to university now?? i don't know what exactly changed my mind; maybe pressure from friends/teachers/family at graduation, but i developed a desire to go. i took concurrent enrollment my senior year through a local university so applying was super simple since i was already technically a student. i said i wanted to study botany lol. i always been a nature hoe tbh.  
anyways, i graduated hs with a 3.711 gpa and 9 college credits. i applied myself and actually tried my freshman/sophomore years, but the last 2 years, i got so lazy and would ditch classes so much and got quite a few c's. i just don't have good study habits so if i do go to college, imma have to work on redesigning my whole attitude and thought processes toward school.
i would really love to get a bachelors in botany. i know college don't guarantee employment (which it should cuz it cost shitloads) but even if i worked at a botanical garden or at a museum that'd work for me. 
in order to get this degree I'd have to take college chemistry I and II, organic chemistry I and II, college physics I and II, college bio I and II, and then a ton of other difficult sounding courses lol. i did pretty good with biology my freshman yr but i dropped college prep chemistry after one semester cuz the teacher never taught and i'd fail if i stayed and never took physics so im kinda scared.
i don't wanna waste all my time getting financial aid and buying books to find out after 2 weeks that im out of my depths and should drop out before i lose even more time and money.
have any of u guys taken physics/chemistry (basic and upper division) in college and if so, how difficult did u find it? i know we all have different skills and some things come easier than others, but i don't have anyone to talk to about this so im kinda desperate haha. 
im also nervous about being on campus and finding my classes and such. i have social anxiety so i tend to keep to myself and hate asking for help. how is college life like? ill just be living at home with my parents to save money so i won't have to live in a dorm or nothing (thank god). but i don't wanna look like an idiot if im wandering around aimlessly tryin find my classes. 
college sounds really overwhelming to me!!! in my head, it sounds like it'll go perfectly but then i imagine myself actually doing it and i come up with a million scenarios of where i fail all my classes, get criticized/made fun of by professors, get lost on campus, never make any friends, etc etc etc... 
i overthink too much but yeh anyways i would just love and appreciate to hear y'alls experience with going to college.",4,1,503.96808080743034,college

I lied about my age to college friends and now I have to tell the truth and I don't know what to do,"Basically everyone I know thinks I'm 18 but I'm actually 20. The reason why I lied is because the obvious follow up question to this statement is why are you a 20 year old college freshman? The reason is personal. The truth is I had to repeat the last two years of high school. It was a mixture of depression, laziness and anxiety that later ended with me attempting suicide. I really do not want to share this information and I really wanted college to be a fresh start and I could just fit in, rather than being the 'oldest one in class' (which is what I was in high school). 
She does know that I was slightly depressed in high school but does not know how bad it was.
I know the fact that I lied is not good for our friendship, but the good thing is that my friend has told me secrets of hers (which are not as bad). I just don't know what to do.
I have to tell her because we signed up to be roommates next year and she will see my age in the form, in the same way I can see hers and there is no way to hide it.
I really need advice.

Asking a professor for a “retake?”,"So posted about my situation in r/ADHD, but there are new developments. Basically, I think I tanked my math test yesterday, which will probably prevent me from maintaining my 4.0 GPA (which I’ve had since hs...god I’d hate to see it go). 

This math class has 5 grades: 4 exams and 1 final. The exams are each worth 18% and the final is worth 28%. But the exams vary in points; my first one was out of 28 points, and my second one was out of 36 points. 

The review and the actual exam were completely different. I and a lot of other classmates couldn’t even finish the test (7 problems). He curves the tests, but we haven’t received the grades back yet, so we don’t know what we really have. On the last exam, someone actually made a 100% so he didn’t curve. 

One of my classmates mentioned that we should ask for a retake? Apparently he doesn’t drop any of the exams to replace with the final, but the classmate said maybe we could just retake it. Our professor is...odd, for lack of a better word. Assigns hw (which we all do) but doesn’t pick it up or grade it. Is only in his office 1 hour a day on the days he’s even there. I’ve looked over the syllabus and it doesn’t say whether he replaces grades with the final or whether he offers retakes. He’s supposed to be primarily a researcher, but for some reason he’s teaching now. So I’m a bit nervous about approaching him about this. 

Is it worth a shot? Has anyone had experience asking for a “retake?” ",17,0,584.3553956222452,college

Can someone answer my questions about college ... im very confused and scared,"Warning : this is going to be long 

Ok my first worry is this : 

I have severe social anxiety that i need to work through and i just found a program i am eligible to go to ( after two years of being rejected for programs ) so that means even before i can get to college i have to do this program and start going to therapy ( ive been before but it didnt work out too well so im trying again ) . And in addition to the program , i'll probably get a part time job ( with the help of the program) so i will be earning money i guess . What im worried about is if i'll be too old for college when im done with it ... because i dont even know how old i'll be when im finished with the program ... im 19 now ... i want to go to college to study art ( fine arts and graphic design ) because i want to be an animator ... which is going to lead me into my second worry . 

My second worry : i am super super bad at art and drawing . And while its always been in my mind that i wanted to do something artistic as a career . I was never like super invested in it but i did draw but only things like cartoon characters that already existed . In highschool and middle school i never took my art classes very seriously because i was underestimated the importance of learning to draw anything but cartoons . So now that i want to draw in a more anime or manga style its really hard because i know nothing of how to do it because the bodies and faces are so much more complex than american cartoons . Which leads me to get discouraged and depressed  and not practice as much as i should because i feel like a failure . When i do draw i try to learn from the first edition book of mastering manga by mark crilley and while its been a little helpful , it doesnt really do much for me but i saw a little bit more of sucess using books by christopher hart but then people say he is a fraud so i dont even know . I think im going to order a book on drawing the human figure so i can practice doing that and a few more christopher hart books and the book pop manga by Camilla derrico . Im just worried about getting discouraged again .Anyway that will lead into my third worry . 


My third worry : i want to go to a community college at first just to get a feel for it ... and what its like . I want to take a fine arts course( to learn those basic skills i am so severely lacking )  , a graphic design course and a psychology course ( in case this whole art thing falls to pieces on me like im so worried it will ) then i want to go to an actual four year college ... except probably for eight years . There i want to take another fine arts course ( yet again to make sure i know how to draw ) and an animation course , and a psychology course ( still planning for the chance this all goes to hell ) then after all that ... i want to take the second part of all those ( fine arts 2 ... etc ) just to make sure i really really know what im doing ... but all that will take 10 years . Because community college is two years . And if i go to four year college twice , thats eight years . Is that too long ? What if im ancient by the time i get out of there ? And how will i earn money while im college ?!? And more importantly even after doing all that will my art skills even improve at all ? Will i end up homeless , poor , and jobless even after all that education ? Im so scared !!! 

Anyways i want to end up being an animator /storyboard artist and maybe make my own manga influenced books . It's alot but i feel like its the only thing ive ever really be interested in . Everything just seems so ... dull and boring .Please help . And any tips you have on not getting discouraged would be really nice . And please just be honest but not in a harsh way like "" your trash and always going to be trash"" 
 becauss i already say that to myself enough really ... anyways if you read all this thank you so much .",6,1,595.7693192333562,college

How do I appeal a scholarship?,"I am a freshman reaching the end of my fall semester. I am attending this school on a scholarship, which pays $15,000 a year. The requirements to keep this scholarship is to have a 3.0 GPA by the end of the semester and take have 15 hours a week.

I meet the second criteria, however the first has become much more difficult.

During the school year I had suffered several issues that impacted my schoolwork. I had a concussion, severe withdrawal from a medication (benzo withdrawal), the flu, severe anxiety (and, at times, depression). a car accident that caused significant back injury, and most recently I had been disowned by my mother and now cannot return home.

These issues have caused me to miss classes and to fail to turn in assignments. However, I am passing all of my classes except for one--one that is known to be a very difficult course. 
I can prove each of these events happening, except for my mother disowning me, with medical documents, letters, and emails.

I have worked with the teacher in the class I am failing, attending her office hours very early once problems started to arise. We continue to work together to find the best option for me.
There is little chance I can bring my grade in that class from an F to at least a C. Of course, I am still trying my hardest.

I am at risk of losing my scholarship, and I would like to prevent that from happening if possible. I do have a chance to appeal the scholarship. Essentially, I want the one failed grade to be ""forgiven"", and to continue school the next semester with the scholarship (as well as retaking the failed course).

If I lose this scholarship, I can no longer afford to go to this school and would have to drop out. Because I cannot return home, I have nowhere else to go and I am afraid of becoming homeless or struggling so much financially at such a young age (18).

Socioeconomic Inequalities in College,"*This is a repost because my last one seemed to have disappeared.* 


**Before I begin this post, I just want to state that I understand life isn't fair. I also know that many inequalities exist. Of course this isn't one of the biggest (and it may not affect everyone), but it still exists, and I just wanted to get it off my chest.**


*[Begin rant]* 


I'm annoyed by the socioeconomic inequalities that influence student life in university, particularly at so-called ""elite"" liberal arts and Ivy League schools. I'm a scholarship student at one of these schools. I go to class, I take notes, I study hard because I see college as a means to a better life one I graduate.


I feel jealous of students who go on vacations with their friends several times a year (which are probably funded by their parents' money because they can't earn that much money working a part time job in college, if they even work at all).


These are the people who use social media to show off their cool, cultured lives, who are obsessed with travel and good food, and who spend money on luxury items.


I once saw a girl shop online during class. She was shopping at some name brand store where there was a sale, but the sale prices were still over a hundred dollars.


A lot of these students come from privileged backgrounds and attended private high schools. Sure, they may work hard academically, but their lives are still pretty easy in comparison. And if they do face a struggle, they can take a semester off if they face a mental health problem (not intending to put down mental health, just saying how some have the means to deal with it easier than others).


I know it's not their fault for having more privlidge, I'm just annoyed by how they act about it.


I have privlidge being an educated person from a middle class family. However, I'm not caught up in my own world, ignoring the realities other people face. I see people like my friends trying to balance three part time jobs in school, while others have bad home lives, or face racial injustices, etc. Everyone faces difficulties, but we can use what we have to learn, improve, and help others along the way.


It's easy to feel alone or isolated in college if you're different from your peers. Can anyone else relate?

Does Community College Suck ?,"After graduating from high school there were a lot of people I knew , who began to attend community colleges. I personally didn't like the selection of the community colleges nearby , and fortunately there happened to be a private  four year college that was about 15 minutes away from where I live. 


I've been loving my campus and the whole college experience, however upon following up a little later with these same people who went to community colleges they dont seem as thrilled.  

I even had one girl tell me that she didn't like that college and literally just  stopped going. 

So I guess I'm wondering why that is. Do community colleges lack the resources needed to have a full college experience? Does the environment of a community college differ from that of a four-year college to a point  where it makes students feel as though they are in the 13th grade? 

I don't know but this is a trend that I'm seeing for some reason. ",10,0,1009.5949673815044,college

What colleges offer the best degree programs in bio-medical engineering? I want to become a neuro-physicist.,"Hello, my name is Aaron and I'm a 25 y/o black male with a high-school degree and some college experience. I live in Ohio, but have no problem moving to get a better education at foreign institutions. I attended a community college for computer coding, but dropped out after some time.
I would like to go back to school this year and begin fresh, with the goal of becoming a neuro-physicist, a lifelong brain surgeon, someone who monitors the mind-body experience and (eventually) someone who creates brain implants to cure diseases.

What are some great medical and engineering schools I can look into? specifically, what schools offer a degree path that is most in line with what I want to do?

Also, what possible set of degrees should I include? I considered going for a dual Physics/Mathematics BS at Wright State University, along with a degree in Chemistry and a major in Bio-medical Engineering.

No one should be 90k in debt when graduating college,"Just watched a CNBC piece called “Why college is so expensive in America”. One person said they were 90k in debt when graduating and I find that completely absurd. I will take the unpopular opinion and say that is her fault and not the fault of the education system. Before going to college, she knew where she would be when she graduated, broke and 90k to pay back. Since she owes so much, I would assume that she is going to some prestigious private school. A school she didn’t get a full ride or likely a scholarship to, but went there because it was her dream school. So I guess what I am saying is that she should have gone somewhere cheaper, and she should not be blaming the education system when from the beginning she knew it would cost an arm and a leg. 


I guess I’m just sick of people complaining about the price of college and how they are 90k in debt. It was their choice to go somewhere expensive and likely without a scholarship. Although college probably is too expensive, I think people should choose somewhere they can reasonably afford and not complain about being 90k in debt because they just HAD to go to their dream school.

Dating in college compared to high school.,"I am a high school girl (senior) who will be going to college (a larger than medium university) next year and living in a dorm. It is a rather selective state university, not affiliated with any religion.

I have heard many tales about college life and dating, many of which are, I assume, not at all true. But some may be true. As far as dating is concerned, is it possible to date guys, even have a boyfriend or relationship, without having sex?

I go on some dates (not that many) in high school. I don't mind making out (actually, I enjoy it) but from the neck up only. Most guys don't mind that I don't go further than kissing (passionate kissing). A few have wandering hands but will behave themselves when I say NO. I like dates and making out, but I do not want sex yet.

This is not for religious reasons, just my personal preference.

How is it in college? Are girls expected to have sex if they go on dates? Should I plan to just stay in my room if I don't want that? Or can I continue to have dates, some making out, but no sex?",10,5,551.2590298815044,college

Odd question: Will colleges revoke admission if I run away from home?,"I know colleges can retract their admissions if you fail courses/commit a crime, etc. But what if I ran away from home for a few days?

Let's clear things up first. I am not depressed and my parents are not abusive. I'm just really bored with my life right now and I want to do something different. There are several train tracks near my neighborhood and I was planning on hopping a freight and living on the road for a few days. 

""But what about the school that you miss. Your grades will suffer?""

Yeah, I got that covered. There's only 3 days left in the semester and I have solid grades in all of my classes. There are no tests left in any of them and I can afford to take zeroes on the remaining assignments. My school does have a policy where if you have more than 5 unexcused absences in a semester for a class, you get dropped a letter grade. But the thing is, there's only 3 days left in the semester and so this wouldn't affect me. 

I've hopped trains before, so I probably won't get hurt in the process of getting on/off the trains. If anything, I would be worried about food. But I have saved up a lot of money and I was planning on carrying plenty of food on me. I don't really know where the train goes, but I know it passes through a state where I have a close friend in. If needed, I could always have him pick me up, and I could hitch hike too. 

I will try to keep this as much of a secret from everybody as possible. I know train-hopping is illegal, but if they don't see me, how would they ever find out? Would having a string of unexcused absences from school would raise some red flags? If I do get caught freight-hopping, is it a serious enough of a crime for them to revoke their admissions?

Panicking over repercussions of sneaking boyfriend into dorm,"I am so sorry for posting again. Really. But I’m freaking out and I can’t find anywhere else to post 


Background: Recently the school changed the guest policy so that now they have to have an online pass which is shown in a tab on the housing portal. My mentally ill and controlling mother doesn’t trust me, and often logs into the housing site just to poke around. Now that there is a specific tab for visitors, she’s overjoyed  bc now she can catch me if I’m “up to anything”. She doesn’t know that I’m dating this person. Sneaking in became one option, while talking to my RA was the other. 

I had planned to meet with my RA yesterday but something came up and she couldn’t make it. 

I went to the movies in a diff city with my bf last night, and when we came back it was around 3. 

My bf couldn’t go back to his place due to his mother needing to sleep in his room (loooong story) so the only place we could go was my room. 

So we snuck in....

I now know that **there is a camera** facing the main doors which is where we walked in. I panicked an couldn’t stop looking at it!! There was no RA at the desk, so we just walked into the elevator hall. There was also a camera in the elevator. 

My boyfriend ended up falling asleep and leaving at like 6 am, at which point there *was an RA at the desk*. I wanted him to leave earlier so there wouldn’t be one, but sleep happened. 

**This is the part where I start to panic**

He said he came out of the elevator, looked through the glass pane in the door at the RA on desk, **she saw him, and then he quickly backed up back into the elevator hall again. He then pulled his phone out and nonchalantly walked past her and outside. He said she definitely saw him but didn’t say anything.**


Since last night was the first night that they introduced the new system, I don’t know if that means they were checking cameras more, or what... 


My boyfriend reasons that **they have no reason to believe that he *didnt* have a visitor pass. I mean, for all that morning RA knew he had been swiped in last night.** Secondly, he reasons that they have no way to know that I let him in unless they check the cameras and see us entering at 3...


How long should I wait before I stop worrying? It’s been almost 12 hours and I’ve heard nothing. I was thinking maybe they would send an email saying that I’m in trouble, etc. I haven’t gotten anything yet but I feel like I need to give them at least 72 hours... the anxiety is killing me 


I have no idea what the penalty is if I’m caught ... **but what if they fine me or EVEN WORSE— take away my ability to get housing ever again?** It’s my first offense, and I’ve never broken a damn rule in my whole time living there... 


I’m pretty terrified since the RA saw him leave, and I know they have to document anything suspicious. **What if they documented him, look through the security footage and see me and him looking at the cameras??** I’m so scared, I recognize I should not have done this. 


Don’t think I’m going to be doing that again. But it sucks since that basically means I can’t live on campus if I want to keep dating my boyfriend.


I recognize that I shouldn’t have done this. Really I do. So please hold off on reprimanding.

So, if I am pledging and working 6 hours a week (probably 5 hours), do you think that too much? Do you think I will get any free time?



Will I get any free time to hangout with my friends outside pledging?



Is pledging fun? Can you tell me about your pledging experience?



Do you get to meet sororities? And do you get time to hangout with them?

(I am asking this because my main objective for rushing is to make a group of friends with both girls and guys that I can hangout with on a regular basis.)

Roommate Troubles,"Hi I am a freshman in college.  I'm 19 years old and i came in to college thinking it was gonna be fun. I don't have to worry about paying bills, working. Just hanging out with friends and having a good time.

NOPE!!!!! 

I'm actually one of those kids that stays in their room most of the day (Except going to classes and eating supper and lunch) 

But every FREAKING TIME my roommate ALWAYS BRINGS IN DIFFERENT GIRLS AND ITS ANNOYING ( I don't want you guys to think I'm gay or nothing) but My roommate is a living cancer. 
And the worst part is.....the chicks he fucks aren't his girlfriends and they're okay with him fucking them. He fucks one of them in the afternoon till 20pm and one at 3:00pm till 3:30pm and the other at 12-midnight to 6 in the morning 
I need sleep 

I try telling him to go fuck them in his car but he says that the girls won't let him and they actually come to my dorm to ""chat"" and keep me company. I'm like ""Bullcrap"" 
You're only in my dorm to do my roommate 

EVERY DAY SAME SEX SCHEDULE ( NO LIE ) 

The girls always ask me ""why don't you like me"" and I just keep on ignoring them 

I actually Sometimes lock my roommate out the door whenever he doesn't have his key and I don't answer the door most of the time because its those three annoying chicks 

But the girls STILL keep bothering me everyday wherever I am (even in the lunchrooms)  they ask ""why don't you like me"" 

Im not gay but I hate when girls only like you for your roommate 

I JUST WANT A NORMAL LIFE 

Please don't take down this post I need answers 

1. What do I do about those annoying chicks? 
2. What do I do about my roommate ?
3. Am I crazy or just overreacting to this cancerous situation ?",7,2,173.05882154817107,college
"A very basic tip from a college freshman who’s very happy, healthy and doing well in class. I immediately found my groove with this one easy trick (professors hate him!)","(Mobile so obv sorry for formatting, also first time posting so sorry if i’m breaking rules etc) 
TL;DR: Use your desk as a work space and your bed for sleeping, that way your mind associates bed with sleep and desk with productivity.

Most dorms have beds and desks i assume? I’ll work under that assumption, because first a very minor tip is invest in a nice desk chair. The chairs that come with the room suck and my $80 desk chair (staples, on sale) is a godsend. It has wheels so i can professor X my way around my floor and it should last all 4 years and beyond, a worthwhile investment. 

Now the real tip, I sleep very regular hours and I only use my bed for sleep. I’m not a productive person, I have an attention deficit disorder, i’m a procrastinator, just not a good student naturally. I used to take naps and would sleep through my work shifts, i slept through my final senior year, when my head hit my pillow during the day I was out. At night I’d spend hours watching youtube before bed. 
Since starting the semester i haven’t been in my bed except for sleeping. I usually go to sleep around 10-12 pm and have woken up before my alarm nearly every day around 7 am. As soon as I go to bed I fall asleep. I spend a lot of time watching youtube, gaming, browsing reddit like one does, but I’ve done this all from my desk. With a comfortable chair I can spend hours at my desk working or whatever and as soon as i get in bed my brain goes “okay sleep time”. 
It’s something so simple that’s gotten me in a healthy schedule I don’t think enough people utilize. Your body really likes routine and if you can set yourself one it makes life so much easier! ",0,0,382.2649789555785,college

I have one crazy story! I promise. My chances?,"I never had a interest in College, until the last couple of months. I am currently a senior in high school in Southern California. The reason why I never had an interest in college is that I have ran many successful businesses over my High school years. My most profitable business a Amazon reseller business that would of made me 150k year full time, needed to get shut (my decision) due to some huge over night rule changes. I had other businesses at the time and still do. From that point on I started researching U.S. coin collecting and history related with it. It was a hobby of mine in middle school, collecting mostly. Well now I have learned how to turn into a profitable eBay business, that I just started. I have been doing some extensive research on the hobby in terms of history in the last few months. I have learned a ton, and now have landed with some important connections due to a huge database project I am doing that will benefit the coin community. I am currently in the process of digitizing every coin news paper article, magazine, books, and advertising supplements regarding Lincoln cents, and error coins released in the last 110 years.  This project has landed me in contact with some higher up people in the coin community. I am talking about people with masters degrees and published authors. I bumped into a guy last night. I told him my whole story. He used to be an admissions officer at the University Virginia. He got his BA at Cambridge and he went to Berkeley and got MBA in business. He was really surprised that I never applied to any 4 year schools. My plan has been all along to just go to a great community college by my house. The reason was because my 9-12th GPA is a 3.2 and my one SAT score is only a 1200. I only took the SAT once. I took it because I was curious what I would score on it not because I was using it for college. Because of that I never studied for it, and didn't put 100% of my effort in it. I have never been any really credible club. However I have around 350 hours of community service, thanks to my dad working for a nonprofit that does a ton of charity work, and also my church. My biggest regret was that I was offered to be a intern at one of top computer crime labs in the country for a police department, I choose to deny their offer because of how busy I with me running my businesses. I regret that decision to this very day. I decided 3 months ago to take up a minimum wage job at a local frozen yogurt place to see how it was working for someone else and what I could learn from so one one day open a retail or restaurant business my self. I still work their, but only a 10 hours a week, its a great experience though. The former admissions officer at Virginia said I was crazy not to apply to any Universities. He said that I would of got accepted to many business schools for my undergraduate based on special circumstances. Now back to research report I am doing. He said that once I finish this report, that it will highly benefit the coin community and that I should publish a book in it. He said he knows of a couple publishers personally and can get me to have a book published. So here are my options, what should I do.  

Option 1: Go to community college, continue this research report, and get a book published in 2 years, and set aside my time consuming profitable businesses. This would help me to get into a top 10 business school to complete by BA

 Option 2: Apply to many universities now, and go where ever I get accepted. I would continue to work on my research project, and still get a book published. I would than transfer to a big business school, for my last 2 years for my BA.

Option 3: Take a gap year. Start running my 2 businesses full time, I am 95% positive I will make 100-130k my first year. And set aside my research project. 

On a side note. I am completely capable of getting good grades. I got straight A's 7-9th grade when I had no businesses running. I didn't start my first serious business until 10th grade. I have thoughts that if I go to community college, I won't be around the best type of people influencing me to drop out of school completely to do work full time. 

Also it just happens that I my new business partner happens to be the smartest kid in my school. Even though he looks completely normal. He has a  5.2 GPA. This is the highest GPA at out school out of 2600 kids, in a middle class area. He also is in the top 99% percentile for the SAT and ACT.  He also happens to work for a huge hospital, and has a written research report for caner that is award winning. He also is in two sports, and is president of 2 of top 5 biggest clubs in our campus. Any advice for him, he still hasn't gotten a response from any IVY league school or Berkeley. He did get accepted into Rice, USC, and UCLA. Any advice for him to get him a response back sooner from the top big schools?

Here’s a lesson college students can learn from lions.,"When a young lion is cast out of the pride to fend for himself, he faces a steep learning curve.

His years of easy meals from his mother and aunts will continue no longer.

Now, he must hunt for himself.

He’s learned the basics from prior generations. But only the bare basics. His hunts will sputter along for some time. Many of his hunts, will be laughable.

He won’t time his sprints correctly. His sprints will begin far outside of the range of his endurance.

He’ll trip over brush. He’ll trip over his own feet.

He’ll foolishly tackle the alpha bull of the herd, getting shaken off like a bad habit.

He’ll wear himself out trying to chase too-fast prey.

Many of his attempts will get him dinged up and bloodied.

He’ll stumble into enemy territory and, if he is lucky, escape with his life.

He’ll stalk too loudly, crunching on loud brush. His hiding spots will be inadequate.

His choice of prey will seem devoid of any logic.

A long list of mistakes will puncture each of his hunting attempts.

He will be reminded of those mistakes as his stomach groans and his juicy prey gallops away.

A thousand generations of evolution will chant: Eat or die. Kill or die. Eat or Die. Kill or die.

Hunting is his singularity, it defines his existence. Every move, every skill, every ounce of effort, revolves around his next kill.

Until he dies or until he eats, he will not relent.

He will eventually get kills. And with each attempt and each kill, he will improve.

He will better time his sprints. He will pick better angles. He will master the geometry of an effective ambush.

He will recognize unfavorable terrain. He will recognize the scent of enemy males. He will draw the lines of territory in his mind. Lines to avoid. Lines of certain death.

His experience will bring recognition. And with that recognition, competency.

He’ll learn to watch the movement of prey, to notice the fluidity of their steps, watching for limps, staggers, fatigue. He will learn to judge the confidence of their posture.

His sharpening eye for weakness will be paired with an increasing capacity for violence.

His legs and back will become stronger. His coordination will improve.

His mane will fill in. His fighting prowess will grow as he learns to use his teeth and claws.

Scars will form on his face and body. They will be visible signals, invitations to oncoming challengers:

“come - let us speak in the language we know best.”

No longer a cub. No longer weak.

He can now hunt. He can now fight. He is ready. He will not die. He will live.


A young male lion has one goal: to eat.

This pursuit, born of necessity, demands well-honed savagery.

Everything he does, every skill, every competency, is a result of pursuing that goal.

When a lion fails a hunt, he extracts only useful information from that failure, and then, he moves forward to his next attempt.

There is no self-pity for failed hunts.

There is no comparing his hunting prowess to that of others.

A lion’s mentality toward success offers a useful lesson to our own goals and path forward.

Treat success as your only option and you won’t even notice the failures. You will only get better.",9,18,17.234712751874767,college

Edit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. 

Edit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) 

Edit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL

"Professor gave me a 0 on an in-class assignment, for which I was absent due to being on an operating table.","I’m a Geographic Information Science Major, and this semester was going so great, until I developed kidney stones. I did everything I could to help my teachers help me; I gave them advanced notice for when I’d be gone, written excuses ASAP. I emailed all of my professors just as a backup while I was in pre-op. Every upper level professor was so considerate and helpful, and offered to aide me in any way possible. Then there was my Public Speaking teacher. She’s a very stuck-up type, who if you ask a question, she just directs you to the syllabus. Well when I noticed a failed grade on the day I was getting a kidney operation, I kindly asked her, “I noticed a zero entered for this assignment. Since I was in surgery that day, is there any way I can make it up? I’d be very grateful.” And her response was, “As per the CMS210 syllabus, students will not be offered the ability to make up missed in-class work.” 
     
It’s really screwing with my mind and doesn’t feel right that I’m suffering in this gen-ed course because of this. Does anyone have any insight on dealing with these types of professors?",251,4539,337.1698759093136,college

Low pass rates are not something to brag about,"I have known a couple of professors (and heard of many more) that will talk about having a low pass rate either for exams or the class as a bragging point. I understand that a class should be engaging and challenging and am of the opinion a degree needs to be earned. However, at a certain point a line needs to drawn. It reflects poorly on you as a teacher. Either your tests are unfair or something else you are doing is obstructing the class.

Walked in on my roommate sucking his own dick,"I honestly don’t mind that much because I’ve seen my fair share of weird shit on the internet, and I’m pretty comfortable with nudity and masturbation, but my poor roommate is probably really embarrased. He immediately ran into the bathroom, got dressed and left out of my suitemate’s door (we share a bathroom with them). I haven’t seen him since then and I hope  he isn’t too mortified to the point where he’s scared to come back to the room. Should I text/say anything to make him feel better or would that just make it worse and I should just act like it never happened? Guess I should knock in the future.

I’m actually kind of impressed he’s that flexible

EDIT: I just sent him a text saying “you’ve got nothing to be embarrased about bro. Sorry for not knocking” and I got a “thanks” back. Still waiting for him to return.

EDIT 2: He just came back and immediately told me extremely apologetically that “he was sorry I had to see that” and I told him it’s all good and to enjoy what makes him happy

Someone got caught cheating on their final today.,"So today during one of my finals, I hear the teacher ask this one guy what he's doing. The guy says nothing, and the teacher demands the jacket sitting on his lap. Guy says ""why would I give my jacket, are you being serious right now?""

Teacher was serious and got the jacket. A phone with presumably answers on it was found. Teacher immediately says ""shut down your computer and leave. You just failed my class"". 

He's already a notoriously hard teacher and has a heavy Chinese accent, so the class was extremely difficult to begin with. But now this student has spent an entire semester, all to be kicked out on his LAST day in class. 

Be careful guys and don't cheat. This was an eye opener. Usually teachers have been lenient and when someone gets caught they just either get a warning or point reduction. But seeing that made my heart drop. It's not worth failing the class and possibly getting expelled!!

Do you guys have any cheating stories that either you yourself did (hypothetically of course), or did someone in any of your classes ever get caught cheating? What happened?

Edit: when I say ""be careful guys and don't cheat"" I'm not saying be careful *while* cheating. I'm saying be careful to make sure you don't even accidentally glance at a neighbors paper, or pull out your phone just to check how much time you have left etc. I've seen people wrongly accused of cheating before due to a stupid mistake like that. So that's what I mean by be careful. Sorry for lack of clarification.

Edit2: yes my school does expel students caught. But it's up to the teacher to report it to the dean. If it's a major class they typically do. If it's an elective they usually just give an F. My school isn't ""lenient"". Idk if he got expelled or not. But that teachers about to be fired for being a horrible teacher, so I doubt he even wants to report anything to the dean. No telling what happened. I've had friends expelled for cheating though, so no my school isn't lazy with their honor policy.",506,2534,161.24707498338765,college

Kicked out of residence hall and terminated from RA position for performing CPR on student.. where to go from here?,"I attend a major university with 25000 students where I was a summer RA (and going to be Fall/Spring as well). The summer term ended for the kids a week or so ago and most stayed in the resident hall for the fall semester. 

During a night round (around 2am), I came across a kid unconscious/not breathing. Now, we were specifically told not to touch any residents (even if injured or dead), but I'm an EMT and nursing student, so my gut reaction was to start CPR (and use my pocket mask which I carry on a key chain). 

I call UPD and our RD. UPD arrived and we were alternating compression until the ambulance arrived. The RD also came but at no point told me to stop. Once the kid was transported to the hospital (he did survive but is in critical condition - he essentially overdose on alcohol), my RD gave me counseling resources but ended the incident with telling me I violated their policy despite helping him and that I would be written up.

Last Friday morning was my judicial hearing with the residence life staff who decided I would be removed effective- immediately from my RA title and the campus residence halls as a resident. Obviously, I am devastated to have lost my job, salary, free room/board, friends, etc... but I am willing to have lost all of that for the kids life who was saved. 

So now, I ask what should I do. Should I take the semester off (I live three hours away), take a loan out for an apartment, somehow find another place? I need help",7,1967,51.03913516857282,college

Doing a project minutes before my presentation.,"I was told this would be appreciated here.

I'm 21 and in my senior year of college but I know there's people here that can relate to this in one way or another.

So last semester, in the final weeks of the semester, I had a powerpoint presentation due in my nutrition class. We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin.

This project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said ""meh, I'll do it later."" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes

S: How's your presentation look?

B: Ha, what presentation?

S: ...

B: ...

S: ...

S: The presentation that's due today.

Let me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life.

B: ...oh shit.

So, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes:

P: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order.

Thank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation.

I literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass.

But yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.

Does anyone else get discouraged when people who cheat on everything and learn nothing make better grades than those who put the work in?,"I know I am furious about it. I used to never care if people cheated, but a classmate made a comment that sent me over the edge. I should mention I am nervous as hell this time of year because I need to maintain my GPA to stay eligible for classes. So I take my grades super seriously lately. 

But there are a few people who blatantly cheat on everything and never learned a single thing all semester except how to say 'no comprendo' to every single question (I'm talking about a Spanish class) and then laugh about it with their group. Those guys also all have A's. 

One guy mentioned to me that he bets I have a high grade if he can get a 90% for the class. I was instantly furious because my average is less than a 80 even though I bend over backwards for that class and need the B to stay in school. 

Is it normal for people to get discouraged like that? You freak out over this class yet someone else barely remembers they're in it and they are the one with the better grade. I'm really not sure how to feel or if I should bring it up with the professor. ",181,1587,323.4687763722765,college

You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. 

As a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. 

Going away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. 

Once you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. 

Don’t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don’t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.

Remember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other’s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. 

Keep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that’s just me. 

Figure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don’t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an 12pm class as my first one that day and sleep until 11:30 and then not want to go to bed until 1 or 2 the following night before I had an 8am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.

Always print things out in advance. You don’t want printer problems to screw you over 15 minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. 

Never feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don’t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It’s important to have a good balance between fun and work. 

Go to class!! Just go. You don’t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what’s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. 

In regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. 

And last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don’t do things you don’t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don’t do something that you don’t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don’t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don’t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. 

Sincerely, 
Your neighborhood sophomore

Do you think professors should be required to speak better English?,"Now before you think this sounds racist or xenophobic or anything please hear me out. I know many professors are only teaching here for research purposes, and many are foreign. And I'm totally fine with that.

But some of my professors grasp of the English language is so poor that it is seriously affecting my ability to be successful in those classes. 2/4 of my professors can barely get their point across, and the majority of the time I have no idea what they are saying. To make matters worse, these 2 professors teach the harder 2 of my 4 classes. Their online slides are just bullet points that they elaborate on with their voice, so that doesn't help either.

What can I do about this? I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is negatively affecting my grade. I could try to teach myself everything, and I likely will end up doing that, but I feel that the university should at least be required to provide a professor that speaks conversational English if we're paying exorbitant amounts for tuition.

Why is no one else raising their hand?,"In the majority of my classes, people don’t contribute to the professor’s questions. They don’t have anything to offer, didn’t read, are shy, idek - but it is so awkward. I always raise my hand, but then I feel guilty for always answering the questions, like I seem like a know-it-all. I wait for others to raise their hand first, to give them a chance and not be annoying, but it always comes down to me having to be the one to contribute.  

No one makes a move or says anything, just crickets. It ends up seeming really unbalanced because I’m the only one talking, but I’d like it if others had something to say, too. Does anyone else experience this? Is this a common thing?",268,1198,47.466704613017264,college

A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,"As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.",86,1182,52.464899057461714,college

"Hey, guys, use a railing.","You know that weird dream sensation where you're in and out of sleep, and you feel like you're falling then jerk awake when you land? Well, that happened to me this morning at 5 am, but I wasnt dreaming, and I woke up halfway between the mattress  and when I hit the floor. 

For reference, my bed is lofted more than 6 feet off the ground. I'm honestly lucky to be alive, and only sustaining ""minor"" injuries at that. Somehow I managed to land in one small area between multiple dangerous corners like my fridge and desk, and I didnt land on my head, but on my knees. My left knee took the full force of a 6 foot drop. It was busted open, and I believe I may have minor fractures in both knees. 

Moral of the story, please for the love of god use a rail; I know it's rare, so rare that the police officer that arrived at my dorm (after I called the police because I couldnt extend my legs) told me I was the first one he'd seen do this in his 35 years on campus.

College gave out my grades to parents without my permission?,"My university gave my parents my GPA and grades. They do not have access to my online grade portal, they do not have access to anything. I in fact have it set in my student portal so they do not have permission for ANYTHING, and I made sure of that. There were a lot of reasons for this that I won’t go into, but my stuff was on absolute lockdown and I made sure of that.

Just a few minutes ago I got a call from my mom asking about my grades last semester, and she went on to name each letter grade I got along with my GPA. She got this from the director of a VERY large department.

"Just a reminder. Even though you are taking your finals, don't forget to evaluate your professors as well.","Title says the point.

Semester is ending and you're about to move on and forget your current professors.  Somebody else still needs to take the course you you just finished.  Pass on what you learned.  

Use your school's feedback surveys (most schools push them or even require them). Use RateMyProfessor.  Just share your experience.  Did the professor torture you by treating their 3 credit humanities course like it was a 6 credit monster worth 30 hours per week?  Was you Bio professor awesome and deserves recognition?  


This matters.  When I go to register for classes, I check my professors ratings.  If there are 3 or less ratings, then it's useless to me.  I would rather take a 3.9 professor with 40 reviews than a 5.0 with 1 review.  You should all be checking these and leaving feedback afterwards. If you aren't reading any sort of reviews prior to registering, it's kinda your own fault when you are stuck with the most difficult professor on campus.

I'm being falsely accused of academic misconduct but I have no proof that I'm innocent,"My roommate and I are in the same year and major so naturally we have a few classes together. Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. 

Fast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now. I don't know how to prove that I didn't cheat and I'm worried about suffering consequences that I don't deserve. Any advice would be much appreciated right now.

Just a few things to consider while on break...,"\- REST DAMMIT. You need to actually sleep and take care of yourself. You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.

\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.

\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your 3rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.

\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.

\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.

\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say ""Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now."" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.

\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.

At my school, a lot of teaching is done by part-time adjunct professors.  They are not industry professionals looking to teach the next generation of engineers, but mostly people working this job and applying for tenured track positions.  




A lot of the teaching is pretty generic, from information you can easily google, and read right off the powerpoint.  My largest criticism is that none of the professors try connecting the material to modern research, so the entire course feels like reading a bunch of wikipedia articles.

College Regrets,"Please read everything.

My biggest regret in life is cheating. I have cheated in every class in college. My mind was too preoccupied with wanting to finish school in 4 years, so I piled on classes every semester. I didnt study. I learned nothing. I would go into class with a game plan to cheat on exams. 

I majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me. 

I am typing this with embarrassment. I beg you to not cheat in college. I faked my way through everything. In 2 months I am starting a new job with a big company and I am so nervous. I don't have the knowledge to to the job, just the degree.

I'm a high school student, in my second semester of my junior year. I have a few universities in mind, but.... I just don't know what I'm doing, and it's leaving me very unsettled and insecure.

Once I apply for college, how do student loans work? Do I take multiple student loans for multiple years? Do I take one big student loan? When do I search for / apply for scholarships? I'm planning on getting a Master's degree (computer science). Is there a separate loan for that?

Once I finish my bachelor's degree and start working on a Master's, do I work at a job concurrently as I study for my Master's? Is a Master's like a bachelor's, where you go to classes (mostly) every day, or is it something different? Is my notion of how a bachelor's degree is obtained even correct?

Back to student loans, when do you have to start paying? What happens if you miss a payment? 

Thanks for the help. I have looked for some type of... ""College tutorial"" but I can't seem to find one, and frankly, I'm terrified.",80,895,251.83188979820244,college
Ever have a class where the amount of work they ask you to put in assignments is paired with a frustratingly laughable point value?,"I'm currently taking a class right now that requires a lot of work for very little value. I'm writing entire papers with multiple pages (required) for a measly five points each. 

All it is doing is burning my classmates out because we write four papers a week for this class. Most of us are literally putting 75% filler in the papers at this point.",68,889,178.37891526116542,college

Anyone ever get a hotel room just to be alone for a minute?,I go to a very big university and for financial reasons I live with five other people in a house. Now some of my housemates are my friends and some are just housemates but either way sometimes I just really want to be alone. I have a roommate so I can’t really just go into my room and be alone. And living with that many people means there’s never more than fifteen minutes when I’m home alone. I’m thinking of honestly just getting a one night hotel stay to recharge and be completely alone for even just like 12 hours.,67,874,22.836403687091337,college

"Early semester reminder: Stop having ""zero"" days","This borrows a quote from [ryans01](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) but the idea has existed for much longer than that.

You're probably a couple weeks into the semester and you may be falling into the early semester trap. You find yourself in a period of time thinking ""Wow, I have no homework this weekend"" or ""Once I turn this in on Wednesday I'm free."" 

It's an illusion. In reality, you have more work to do; it's just not due until later.

Spend your free days getting started on that work. Even if just for a few hours. Don't have any more days of non-productivity. And by working, I mean really working. Not just staring at a textbook to kill an hour or going to class like you should already be doing, but actually spending Friday making headway on an assignment that's not due until next Wednesday, or getting caught up in a class where you know you're behind.

I give this advice for 3 reasons. 

\#1, A lot of college students (including myself for many years) miss points on assignments because they underestimate how much time it will take to complete. That's the dumbest reason ever to lose points. You're just hurting yourself for no reason.

\#2, Most students' schedules have a natural ebb and flow: crazy amounts of stress before deadlines, and free time elsewhere. It's not balanced nor healthy. It's the reason some students can't take the pressure when it really builds up. Delegate your work more evenly and you'll still have the ability to take time off and relax, just with less stress hanging over your head.

\#3, It builds discipline. You have to teach yourself to work even when you don't want to. That's the difference between discipline and motivation. Motivation is nice, but it won't last you all year long. Discipline will. 

I hope this is read by at least one person who can apply this to their situation. It will change your grades, your time management skills, and your relationship with your work.",30,874,390.0096444278321,college
Remember to be grateful you get to go to college.,"I know it's kind of pop culture to complain about college, complain about finals, and even complain about school in general. 

But remember to acknowledge how lucky you are to be able to go to college to forward your thinking. The fact that so many of our generation go to college may seem bleak for job security, but remember how amazing it is that we are moving towards an educated society! 

I think back to every day people in the 1800's. There's a meme about a doctor telling someone they have ghost in their blood and to do cocaine. I know it's a joke, but that probably would have made sense to the average every day Joe in that time period. But the forwarding and plethora of educated people has eliminated many of these false understandings. (ex. What causes illness and how to cure it. Technological advancements, etc.)

Education also opens doors. I've met a few special individuals. One of which started out as just a poor black kid from a village in Africa. Through a Christian organization sponsoring him he was able to grow up healthy and educated, and eventually got to go to college. He ended up getting his masters in engineering. Now that poor village black kid makes a lot more money than I probably will and he used that money to help his family village and the Christian organization.

Just remember to pay thanks to the people who give us the privilege to go to college. Try to not take it for granted.

Edit: I deleted the part about people joking about suicide because some people were offended. College puts a tremendous toll on the mind. I know personally from my struggle with anxiety and panic attacks and some past struggles with depression. Please seek assistance if you are suffering.",99,868,531.5458481315358,college

Roommate refuses to lock the dorm door,"My roommate REFUSES to lock our dorm door, I’m a band member and own multiple instruments, an expensive computer, monitor, iPad and more. The other day I opened my door to find a person I had never seen before standing in the middle of my room, I said “hey man!” And the rando said “hey!” And bolted past me, out the door and down the hallway to the elevators. I told my roommate about this and he just says “he probably just had the wrong room” I have confronted my roommate 3 or 4 times and I told him he has to lock the door, today over snapchat this was his word for word message he sent “Dude I’ve already been here a year and me and my buddies know everyone on this floor nothings getting stolen bud. You can lock it that’s fine but I’m not going to” this got me absolutely fuming, I feel like I’m about to explode and I feel the moment he enters the room I’m going to go berserk. The RA has been gone for the past couple days including today so I have nobody to turn to. Any tips? On both calming me down and getting him to lock the door, I don’t feel like having to pay what would be equal to another year of college if my instruments get stolen, not to mention the sentimental value of them from the generations before me that passed them down.

Edit: is there anyway to get him kicked out of my room? If it helps, A few days I found his secret stash of Busch Light, and he vapes like crazy when I’m not around, when I go into the room from a day full of classes, it reeks like burning sugar.

Edit: I do have a description of the random who was in my room before and his shirt had a last name on the back I’ll definitely bring that up with my RA

Edit: I gotta get to sleep and it’s nearly 1:00, I got a class at 9:00, I’ll save the sleep deprivation for exams later in the year, thanks for the sound tips, and the funny things you guys are saying in the comments. you guys rock..... and roll. See y’all in the morning.

Update: I have set an appointment with the RD today at noon, it is currently 10:00. At first they said he wasn’t available today, until I brought up that it was a security issue. They said it needs to get resolved immediately so they are making an exception. Wish me luck on making my case, I’ll update you guys on what happens

Update: my RD said that I need to file a police report and have the police talk to my roommate directly, also they are going to expedite the moving process and get him out of my room within a week, also spotted my RA at lunch and he said he is going to take care of it immediately.

Update: Police said they are going to talk to the RD to set up a talk to make sure he locks the door, in the meantime while they get the move paper work finalized. I don’t think he is going to be very happy about the police showing up at our door, but that’s the price you pay when you don’t have respect for others.

GUYS, FINAL UPDATE: My roommate is moving out tomorrow, officially, 1 floor down. I am ecstatic thanks for all of your guys’ help!",168,858,36.051021742646896,college
Got a 46/100 on my first exam that's related to my major..is it time to panic a little?,"Title pretty much says it all. I got a 46/100 on a biology exam.

Someone in my College made a petition to suspend everyone who has been accused of sexual misconduct,"A girl in our second year accused someone, but the legal system will take 6 months. So she started this petition, with the goal of getting everyone accused suspended until a verdict is reached. It seems mainly geared towards this one guy, but the title and text still call for all suspects to be suspended.


In the groupchat of my year people are angry, calling for suspension even though no proof has been shown yet. People seem to have done away with the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'. I want to support victims, but this just seems crazy!


On top of that, one of my best friends had also been falsely accused by a different girl (weeks before). He is having a breakdown, his depression making a swift comeback because of the accusation. I truly believe he is innocent, they hooked up multiple times, she was sober and they even showered together. But she had a boyfriend, as he found out later, so possibly she didn't want to own up to it. He has moved out of our building already on request on the uni, but still studies with us.


What can I do to ensure people aren't getting suspended based on accusations alone? Is a petition like this even legal? I am personally rather upset by the amount of ire this has elicited. When I defended maybe not punishing someone without evidence I got some angry comments thrown my way.

___


EDIT: I want to put this into perspective, there is no physical protests or anything going on, just discussions in the groupchat. However, the petition now has 681 signatures. I assume most of them are just out of solidarity, but the title of the petition is ''MY UNIVERSITY to Suspend Suspects of Sexual Crimes from Education'' so it isn't exactly covert in its intentions. It is only a petition, but still.


There are people speaking out against this luckily, so it isn't as bad as it could be.",129,854,212.56532729820248,college

Alcohol - thoughts on staying alive,"In the freshman question megathread, a redditor asked what I found to be a disturbing yet common question:

>Got drunk for the first time on day 2, spent the rest of the night (read: right now) vomiting my brains out  
>  
>How do I like, not do this next time  
>  
>I suppose the obvious answer is ""just don't drink as much"" but now that that's covered I'm open to other ideas

Below is my answer to that redditor.  Please add any safety tips that you have regarding responsible use of alcohol.

>Welcome to your first (and hopefully only) bout of alcohol poisoning. That shit is deadly.  
>  
>**DO NOT DRINK SO MUCH.**  
>  
>First of all, if you're underage, don't drink. I have to say that, it's a sub rule to not engage in or advocate for illegal behavior.  
>  
>Second of all, assuming you are of age, control your consumption. That means a few things:  
>  
>1. Know how many drinks are in your cup. A filled 16 oz solo cup is 1.25 beers, 4 wines, and a deathsentence of liquor.  
>  
>2. Know that your body can only process 1 drink per hour. A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. *Pace yourself.*  
>  
>3. Keep track of how many drinks you've had and over what period of time. Look at your phone when you start drinking, else you'll have no idea when you started. Look at it every time you get a new drink, else you'll have no idea how much time has gone by. *Pace yourself.* **IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY DRINKS YOU'VE HAD, YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY AND IT'S TIME TO STOP.**  
>  
>4. The feeling of inebriation is, in my experience, a delayed effect. By the time you feel buzzed, if you're still drinking, you're going to get drunk. By the time you get drunk, if you're still drinking, you're going to get sick. *Pace yourself.*  
>  
>5. When you've had enough, and someone offers you another, for the love of God **SAY NO THANK YOU**. If you have to walk away from a game of beer pong, so be it. *Pace yourself.*  
>  
>2,000 college students will probably die from alcohol this year. That's twice as many people as get shot dead by police every year. This is no fucking joke. Take care of yourselves.",167,854,56.57808192783207,college

PSA to all students (specifically freshman),"STOP PACKING YOUR STUFF EARLY!

It's extremely rude to start shuffling papers, zipping up your bags, and chatting to your neighbor with 5-10 minutes left of class while the prof is still talking. Especially when it's a big lecture hall, it's very hard to hear for students around you.

I say specifically freshman because I'm in 3rd year and people still do it in my programs, but it's the odd couple first year classes I have that are the worst.

Just wait till the end of class. If you are really in a hurry then arrange yourself so that when the prof is finished speaking, it's easy to pack your things and leave.

Edit: If you must leave early to not be late for your next class then so be it. But have some sort of exit strategy, keep your bag unzipped till you leave the classroom, sit as close to a door as possible, generally don't make a ruckus. My post was more aimed at the cumulative effect of the whole class who think packing up and chatting before the prof is finished is acceptable. The odd few people who must leave early can very well do so in manner that doesn't disrupt anyone and that is totally fine.",86,852,271.30050090931354,college
Professor was late to a final and said it was our fault,"Hey I’m not sure where to post this but I’m kind of at a lost for what to do. It’s currently finals week as many of you know and I have been studying my ass off. Today I had a midterm for my psych class that was set to be at 3:30pm, I know this because on the online finals schedule that every professor follows it stated 3:30pm was the time of the final. So me along with a majority of my classmates show up at 3:30 and waited but my professor failed to show. We spoke to the head of the department and they informed us that if the teacher does not show in the next 30 minutes then we were legally(?) exempt from the exam. Every person that showed up signed their name on a piece of loose leaf as proof of their attendance, we then brought the paper to the head of the department to get it signed. We emailed the teacher a picture of the attendance sheet and a small paragraph explaining that we showed and she failed to show up on time so we were directed to leave. Anyways, 4:30 rolls around and we get an email from the professor saying that the exam was actually at 4:30 and she stated this in class last week and since we were not there for the exam we would all have to reschedule it and take it with a proctor on another day. Now this is where I’m at a loss because there was no follow up email or anything other then her ALLEGEDLY (i’m emphasizing this because if she stated it I’m sure no one would of showed up at 3:30)  stating last week in class that it was moved to 4:30. Is this something that is allowed??? Correct me if I’m wrong but I think this is extremely unfair to everyone. Does anyone have any experience with this or know of what I should do?? 

Update: I couldn’t make it to the school because something came up (I had no final scheduled for today so my mom asked me to go with her to the doctor). However I did email the dean about the situation as well as my professor asking when I could reschedule the test because at this point fuck it I’m just going to take it and I know I’ll get a good grade on it anyways because I’ve studied a hell of a lot. Anyways, back to the stuff you guys care about- no one has responded to my emails. I sent both emails out at around 9am and I’m still waiting to hear back. Seems like I’m not much of a priority 🤷🏻‍♀️

New update: my professor emailed me back and my new test date is Monday at 11. I also still haven’t heard back from anyone else so that’s disappointing. ",137,847,306.2200379463506,college

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting 101?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have 4 years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The 4 years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those 2 friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. 





I was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!). Stay calm, remain positive, and try to follow the basic advice outlined in this thread. Good luck! ",150,827,417.0327115574617,college
The world is crumbling around me please help.,I am a freshman at my university right now and I seriously feel like everything is crumbling down around me.

Loneliness at college,"How do you deal with loneliness at college? I’m an international student and I was raised with a huge difference in the environment/ideas for fun. I only have a few friends/people I know. Most people here just drink, party, or binge watch in the weekend. To make things worse, most people here are in state students and already know each other or have a lot in common. My roommates don’t do anything but play video games, study, and watch stuff online. The only thing I can think of is going to the gym but I can’t get over my social fears because I’m small and skinny.

I think my professor has actually lost it,"I apologize as this is going to be quite long but I actually think this woman has gone crazy; We had lecture on Wednesday and it seemed to be a normal class, the only thing different was she said she had to cover for a colleague so she couldn’t have office hours that day. Fine by me. After the class she sent out a class wide email explaining that the whole class she had never seen us being so disrespectful and we made her day worse because of some “Tragic/traumatizing news” she received regarding a colleague. She had also individually emailed me asking me about a question I had in class that day. I tell her i’ve understood it now and thanked her for helping. She then emails me back saying that she had already explained why the exponent was negative 20-30 times and me asking that question had completely thrown off the flow of the lecture and told me I need to pay attention more and that it “can’t/won’t happen again.” Yesterday, We had lab without the professor and apparently she had done this to several other students as well. She has also sent several other class wide emails that just said “there will be a pop quiz on Friday with no equation sheet. be prepared.” Am I wrong for thinking that this woman has lost it?

Here it feels like everyone’s a clone of each other. And I can’t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus.

Being charged 17USD to submit my homework? Is that ethical and should I switch classes?,"Sorry if the formatting is weird for this, I'm on mobile.

I'm a recent college freshman and for my stats class our teacher wants us to pay 17 dollars to submit our homework despite the fact that  we already use a program we can submit our homework on. Ontop of that her syllabus essentially says to not bother her with any questions whatsoever.

""Before reaching out, I expect you to put effort into answering your own questions. When you ask me a question, I will ask you to show me what you've already done to find the answer, and if it's clear that you haven't read the course notes or the provided readings, you will need 
to do that before we revist.

Not hearing back from me (such as having a question on an assignment) is not an excuse for not being able to turn the assignment in on time. Everything should be clearly explained in the assignments section of Canvas, including what format to submit your assignment in.""

My friend says I should just stick it out because this class is a requirement for my major, but this isn't really the type of learning environment I feel will actually benefit me. Should I just suck it up or find another class that meets the requirements?

And here is another post from this subreddit that goes far deeper into the importance of habit and routine forming than I have. (I agree with everything on the post)

https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4wrp56/what_i_tell_incoming_freshman_every_year_good/

All advice on that post aligns with at least one, if both,  of the college books I've read. Srsly read it lol.

P. S. (entirely unrelated) I found a survey app called Pulse for college students exclusively. They often ask questions about depression, school, etc. If you have the time/are interested pls use my referral code (you also get 250 pulse points, note it's only 1200 to redeem a 3 month trial in skillshare) : Follow the link below or enter the code o8yddW5VOR in the app. https://bbuw.app.link/o8yddW5VOR

The survey results are pretty interesting and cover areas like dating, alcohol, intelligence, depression, school etc. It's restricted to college students with a college email address. you can redeem prizes like a 3 month trial to skillshare with just 60 surveys (2 minutes each).

"My professor lowkey called me stupid, for no fault of my own. The worst part? I wanted to work with him on project.","College started a month ago, before joining I had seen this professor's profile, research and was quite impressed. I possibly wanted to do my Masters dissertation with him. 

We have lab sessions which said professor takes. I was performing experiment assigned to me. It was done by a batchmate in the session before it. The said batchmate tells me to do experiment in X way which I find very dubious. Like, we were supposed to find a quantity (Wavelength) and the said classmate used a ready-made chart of wavelength which frankly made the experiment pointless. Whereas the instruction sheet told to do it in Y way. Mind you that we have done experiments in way that are not given in instruction sheets before. 

Let me tell you that I have a lot and lot of self doubt so even if I know that the X way to do stuff is wrong, I go and ask the professor to confirm. He's super condescending and asks me to figure it out on my own. By the end of lab session he asks me- ""so... What was your question again?"" I say it and he is like ""I generally don't say this...but this question was frankly stupid"". Fml.

Do you ever have panic dreams you missed the first week of class or something of that nature?,"Even though it's the summer and I am only taking online classes, I seem to have have them once a week. Last night it was that I mixed up the start times for all of my classes the first 2 days and than couldn't find the building my classes were in and I got dropped from my classes and than dropped from the university. Which is a crazy scenario, especially considering I am one of those kids who is 30 minutes early to every class in the first week to prevent something like that from happening.

Write Drunk + Edit Sober = Success,"I have a 7 page essay due on Sunday, and I found that if I have a drink before I start writing, I'm able to output much more than usual.

 When I'm sober, I'm anxious. I always try to find the perfect words to write on an essay. I'll write a sentence and say ""hmm that doesn't sound right"" or ""no no no my professor won't like this I should redo it."" 

But when I'm tipsy, I'm bold. I have much more of a ""I'm gonna write this and you're gonna f\*cking like it"" attitude. I can type sentence after sentence without stopping and not care about perfecting it, while using complex vocabulary and maintaining a formal tone.

I just finished the last final of my college career. Here are some of the things I've learned over the past five years.,"**Academic**

* Don't freak out if you don't immediately love your major when starting out. I majored in criminal justice and for the first two semesters I was really unsure of my choice. But I decided to stick it out, and I'm very glad I did. 

* However, if you REALLY don't like what you're studying, don't be afraid of change! Do some research, decide what's important to you, and TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR. 

* Seriously, talk to your advisor. They're there to help you. If you're worried about a class, or need a change, a good advisor will have your back.

* Obviously you want to get good grades; that's a big part of college. BUT: Don't think it's the end of the world if you get a B-, or a C, or even a D in some cases. Take a breath. Calm down. You're not going to flunk out of college because of one bad grade. We've all had classes we struggle with (that was math and science for me). The important thing is that you try your best and don't let it take over your life.

* If you are having trouble with a class, like you're just not getting the material and keep struggling, talk with the professor! Most of them are more than happy to help you out. Also look for tutoring programs. I used one to help pass statistics and it saved my grade.

* While signing up for classes, if you know one of them is going to be more of a challenge, try to give yourself some breathing room. For instance, when I took statistics, I made sure all my other credits were criminal justice related because A) I knew that material well and B) they were more enjoyable. Spread out the misery, so to speak.

* Don't skip class unless you actually HAVE to, not because you WANT to. I shudder thinking back on how many times I skipped and what it probably did to my grade. Some classes, especially first/second year ones, also count attendance towards your points.

* I know the saying ""sleep is for the weak"" is popular, but don't take that to heart. Sleep is important. Putting off a project/studying for a test until the day before and pulling an all-nighter isn't going to turn out well.

* However, if you DO have to pull an all-nighter, try to get at least some sleep. Some people can run on three or four hours, others need more. Listen to your body.

**Dorm life**

I lived in a dorm for the first two years of college before getting an apartment. Here's some tips:

* Yes, ramen is cheap at first glance, but it's utter shit in terms of nutrition. It's also not as inexpensive as some people believe. A 10lb bag of rice, in the long run, will be much cheaper (and healthier!). Learn to use spices, even just basic ones. Here are some other cheap, relatively healthy foods and ideas:

1) Eggs

2) Fruits like bananas, oranges, etc

3) Potatoes

4) Frozen veggies

5) For breakfast: Oatmeal, healthy cereal, etc

6) Replace soda with tea, or even seltzer water if it's the fizz you miss. I've got a love affair with Safeway-brand orange seltzer now. Avoid energy drinks at all costs. They're 99% sugar and can wreck your body.

7) Seriously, learn how to season. A little bit of spice goes a long way. Cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder are some of my go-tos.

* Exercise. Even if it's just fifteen minutes a day walking, or a short jog, or doing a few reps of weights in your room. You feel 10x better and your body will thank you.

* It's easier to keep your room clean by maintaining a regular chore schedule than trying to clean everything up at once. 

* FFS, wear shower shoes/sandals. Communal showers are gross. Chances are some nasty-ass dude probably jerked it in there that morning. 

* If you've got roommates, be respectful. My first roomie and I were total opposites in terms of hobbies and habits, but we got along just fine because we respected each other, did necessary chores, kept the room clean, and was aware of each others' sleeping/studying schedules. Basically, don't be a dick.

* Try to be nice your RA's. I know some of them can be assholes (speaking from experience, I was one for a while) but they're just trying to do their jobs most of the time. Go to them if you've got an issue.

* Don't totally rely on meal plans if that's a thing at your college. Mine, if used as the college intended, would only get you one meal a day. Learn to cook basic stuff and you'll save a ton of money in the long run.

* Keep your goddamn music down, or wear headphones. Seriously.

* It can be challenging, or even downright scary to try and meet new friends, but at least give it a shot. I'm extremely introverted and it took a while to start meeting people, but it was worth it. Don't just hole up in your room all day.

**Work/school/social life**

* Working while going to school can be a blessing and a curse. The income is great, but if you're taking 18 credits at the same time it sucks. If you can, try to find a job with flexible scheduling. University/college jobs are usually really good about this.

* While it is possible to work full-time and go to school as well, it can SUCK at times. I did that this past year working midnight shift. There were a lot of days I was running off three hours of sleep. I also sacrificed any semblance of a social life. 

* The same guidelines above apply to internships. If you're having to bend over backwards and sacrifice your soul to make it work, you should ask yourself if it's worth it. 

* Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can. It's a bit cliche, but it's true.

* You need to have a day or two off now and again to decompress. I've met people who dedicated themselves solely to schoolwork pretty much 24/7 and it wrecked them by the end of the semester. Conversely, think of college like a job. Do the work and don't slack off. It's all about balance.

* On the topic of parties: Be safe! Never leave your drink unattended. Have a sober driver, take an uber, walk, but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL WHILE INTOXICATED. The same applies to any other illicit substances. Intoxicated/impaired drivers are the scum of the earth. Try to have a sober friend with you if you're going somewhere unfamiliar, or with people you don't know well.

* Have fun! College is supposed to be enjoyable. Don't torture yourself just because you think it's 100% about getting good grades.

* Mental illness is a big issue in college. Don't ever hesitate to get help if you need it, even if you don't think it's a ""big deal"". You wouldn't just tough out a broken leg or bacterial meningitis; don't treat your brain the same way.",44,702,522.1617509093136,college

I'm a professor: This is what I tell my family members BEFORE they go to college.,"I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. 

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's. ",128,677,919.1006860944988,college

A guide to life in college (long post),"This guide was written out of inspiration from a reddit comment that I wrote in response to someone asking how to get a 4.0 in college. My advice was not to focus on the grades as much as the overall learning experience, and other important aspects of college, which often get overlooked from a usefulness perspective. These aspects include networking, learning outside of the classroom, exposing yourself to new things, and keeping ones life balances, and trying to keep oneself healthy, both in body and spirit.

## First off:

Balance is important to maintaining a healthy life and maximum productivity. The amount of stuff you get done is not based purely on the amount of time in which you attempt to be productive. Procrastination is often a result of emotional stress and anxiety, and not laziness. Telling yourself to ""just do something"" will not make it easier to be productive towards a particular goal.

This guide aims to give you advice on how to effectively manage your college experience.

## Time Management

Time management is an essential part of being productive. You don't need to account for every second of every minute, but you need to create a schedule that works for you. Attempt to find the worse uses of your time, and eliminate them form your habits.

Use time between classes wisely.

Try to track time and figure out where it goes.

## The Big Five

I like to think of ""the big five"" them as MEDSS ""meds"" with two s's. The big five are meditation, exercise, diet, sleep, and social (activity). Incorporating these into your life on a regular basis will vastly improve it. There may not be any magic pill, but these things will improve your life likely more than any medication will (with some notable exceptions if you are gravely sick). ""The Big Five"" also

### Meditation

Meditation can be easily started with an app such as headspace, or insight timer (I believe there are many others, these are just the ones that I happen to use). Only takes 10-20 minutes a day, and you will see real improvements in your life.

### Exercise

Exercise should be done at least 3x a week, and can be in very many forms. You can do strength training, yoga, cardio (running, rowing, stair stepping, HIIT), climbing, team sports, and many other things. I personally do strength training with some cardio thrown in (not as often as I should with the cardio, but I'm working on it). **Remember, an exercise activity you will do is more important than something that is ideal for maximum health, that you never do.**

I believe that strength and cardiovascular training should be included in everyones workout routine. I personally started strength training with Stronglifts 5x5, and I highly recommend it as something that is simple and easy to get started with. Starting strength is another good option. Please note: you _need_ to use proper form, or you will end up injuring yourself over the long run, I suggest watching the Stronglift's videos and reading the articles on form, and getting a knowledgable friend to check your form. (this does not take much time, just an hour or two, and you don't have to do it all at once)

You can avoid injuries by starting light and working on your form as you add on weight. If you follow Stronglifts you shouldn't have an issue. I did it for 2 years and was previously totally untrained (no previous lifting experience). With 3x a week I made some serious progress. Additionally, strength training will increase the amount of muscle on your body, while decreasing the amount of fat (depending on your diet), so you'll look *hotter*.

### Diet

I am no expert on diet, and there are many debates over what is healthy, mainly make sure to limit your caloric intake (so that you don't gain weight), and to lose weight if you are overweight. I recommend looking into fasting, as it seems to be a useful tool if used properly. HOWEVER PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND NOTE THAT FASTING CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOSING MEDICATIONS.

I also suggest focusing on eating foods with less added sugar, making sure you get your proper daily intake of nutrition. If you want to lose weight, cutting out any beverage that is not water can make a huge difference. Additionally, eating foods that fill you up can help you eat less, since you will be satiated.

Note: if you start lifting, make sure you eat enough, otherwise it will stunt your progress

### Sleep

Sleep is something that very many people vastly overlook. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night is essential for your physical health, emotional wellbeing, and especially for your productivity. Productivity is not a function of hours in times some constant is equal to productivity. Productivity has many factors including your state of mind, how clear your head is, are you actually able to sit down and work to get started. You may gain 2 hours in the day by sleeping 6 hours a night, or gain 4 hours by sleeping 4 hours a night, but you will murder your productivity and health not only in the long run, but in the short run.

Two weeks of getting 6 hours a night is like having a 0.08% BAC, the legal limit. Also staying up for 18 hours consecutively produces similar effects. Sleeping less may be okay for one night at a time, but if you do it every night, you will be less productive, despite having more hours to work.

A very small percentage of the population can manage getting by with less than 7-8 hours, but they are a tiny minority. About 1-5% of the population, I forget the exact statistic. YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THAT GROUP.

College kids, and people in general like to brag about how little sleep they get. Don't be like them, get a healthy amount of sleep. You'll come out ahead in the long run.

Sleep is especially important the nights before exams.

Additionally, try to go to bed at the same time, and wake up at the same time every morning, including weekends.

No blue light before bed, preferably no screens at all. Try reading a book. :)

### Social (activity)

Believe it or not social activity is important to good health. I happened to ignore this for many years, because I tend to isolate myself when I am busy and stressed, and figure I can get more done by staying in my room for days at a time. Social interaction during the day is good, but taking time to get away from your room/routine also does good, especially if you can go to a game night, or concert, or whatever with friends. I don't know exactly what the research says about frequency, but I'd suggest trying to do something at least once a week for a couple of hours. By this, I mean do something outside of normal mingling and gossiping at your workplace, before and after classes, etc.

Social accountability is another powerful tool that will help you. If you can get your friends to be disappointed in you when you don't study properly, or do something you're supposed to do, like exercise, it will be a massive deterrent against doing things poorly. Additionally, finding an exercise buddy can be useful to help you blow off steam, and to encourage you to exercise when you don't want to.

A large part of college is the developing of social relationships, even though you may not be told this going in. Take time to date, meet new people, join clubs, try new things. You will likely not have many of the same opportunities again

Don't hang out with people who are going to get you to do stupid things, and who don't have any ambitions, they _will_ drag you down with them. It doesn't matter if they are good people at heart.

On the flip side, if you hang out with hardworking and successful people, they will encourage you to work harder, and you'll see what helps them succeed. After college they'll be helpful to help you network.

I seriously regret not spending more time with people in college, my mental health would've been better, and I would have likely had better grades as a result, hell maybe even a girlfriend, or some fun stories to tell.

### Dating

**_Never again in life will you be surrounded by so many attractive peers, who are generally open to  many with high ambition. Make use of this opportunity._**

However, keep in a mind, a good relationship may improve your life a little bit, but a bad one will make it much worse, in other words, get out of bad relationships as fast as you can, and preferably stay away from toxic individuals.

## Grades

My original response was to someone who asked about getting a 4.0 in college. My response was, don't focus on an arbitrary target, so much as making sure you use your time wisely. If you are trying to get into medical/law/dental or other professional schools, or into graduate school, having a good GPA is important. However, there are things to consider about GPA.

Say getting a 2.5 GPA takes 10 hours a week of studying, 3.0 takes 15 hours a week, 3.5 takes 25 hours a week, and a 3.75 takes 40 a week, and maybe a 4.0 takes 50 hours a week. Diminishing returns start to kick in heavily. What if you spent that time doing research, or interning, or in clubs and activities that help you build your network. Hell, maybe you could start your own company. Outside of getting into graduate school or a professional program, your GPA won't really matter past your first job. That being said, I'd shoot for at least a 3.0-3.5. (these numbers are 100% made up, find the balance that works for you and your goals)

Find the balance between schoolwork and research, internships, and clubs or other activities. The balance point will be different for everyone.

Your connections, will matter for the rest of your life, as your friends start to move from company to company, and as some of them climb corporate ladders and start their own companies. These connections will get you farther than an extra .25 on your GPA ever would.

**Do not beat yourself up over bad grades**, if you do this you will increase your chances of developing depression. Focus on managing your time effectively. If you manage your time effectively and do not receive the grades you want, it sucks, but it's okay. You can only do so much, and if you are making the most of your time you should be proud of yourself. Continual improvement is more important than perfection. Consistency is also very good.

Consider trying to develop good relationships with a handful of professors who you will use as references for jobs, recommendation letters, etc. It is especially useful if you do research or other non-coursework related activities with them, as they will get to see more of who you really are, and your work ethics.

### Studying

There are effective, and ineffective ways to study and complete coursework. Start off by _going to class_, it'll really make a difference even if you don't think you're learning much. Go and take notes by hand. Taking notes by hand is the most effective way to make sure you're internalizing the information from the lectures.Additionally, ask questions in class, and go to office hours, it doesn't matter if you feel like an idiot, your understanding of the course material is more important than what your classmates think. Most of the time other people in the class have the same question. If you're too afraid to ask during class, go to office hours (this is also a good chance to develop a relationship with professors).

Reading the textbook can be useful for some classes, but not so much for others.

Do homework. Homework gives you practice, and practice makes you better at remembering material, and using complex problem solving abilities. The more you develop problem solving abilities, the easier any question will become.

[This video] is a good source for evidence based studying techniques.

My advice is to trying and make connections between all the concepts in your mind, and how they relate, this will enable you to remember things you forget through related information, or may make you able to reconstruct a piece of information from other pieces of information. This technique has been useful to me many times. People often waste lots of time using rote memorization, but if a question on an exam is slightly different than something they expect, they'll be totally lost, whereas someone who understands the concepts well can adjust quickly, and digest the information.

I did disproportionately well on many exams despite my sometimes lackluster performance on homework. I believe it was due to my focusing on understanding of concepts, and not memorizing problem solutions.**Dumb songs, acronyms and other mnemonic techniques will make things easier to remember, even if they sound stupid.**

On exams I start at the beginning, and when I get stuck on a question, I stop and move on to the next one, often times a solution to something I was previously stuck on will come to me eventually. It is also good to look at all the questions on an exam before starting so you think about them in the back of your head. I don't know if this is pseudoscience, but it works well for me.

Study over weeks, don't cram the night before an exam. Also, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before an exam, it doesn't matter how much you studied if your brain is functioning at 25% capacity because you didn't sleep before the exam. Get 8 hours.If you're interested in learning to master your memory, check out ""Moonwalking with Einstein"". Anyone can train their memory to memorize lots of things quickly, which can be useful for some classes (and less useful for concept based classes). However, this will take time. I have not tried practicing the techniques, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read.

I suggest figuring out every class you want and are required to take, and make a timeline of when you'll be taking them. Maybe you'll see if you can dual degree or double major, it's much easier to do now than in a few years. Classes will get harder (probably).

You might consider taking a few classes in different disciplines in order to make sure you want to stay in your major, it'll make switching easier if you have a few classes done.

Or, consider doubling down and finishing your classes a year early so you can graduate, or maybe start taking graduate classes and do lots of research.

Take breaks from homework and spread out assignments, sometimes going to bed and then looking at the assignment in the morning will make a difference. Try to do them as soon as they are assigned (assuming you have been taught all you need to do them). This gives you more time to reach out to professors and TA's, and time to put them away when you get stuck.

He can handle his alcohol and has never blacked out like that or woke up in a hospital. Is it possible he was slipped something, or is it more likely he just drank a fuck ton and someone brought him to a hospital thinking he was really fucked up?

only reason why i’m entertaining the idea he got drugged is because he’s not hungover... just confused as to where his night went.

Tips From Someone Who's Graduating Soon,"Alright so it's finally my senior year and I'm gonna give you my college cheat codes: 

1. Try to sparse out your classes throughout the week. Nowadays some schools follow the MW and TTH rule, meaning like some classes might be on Monday and Wednesday while others will be Tuesday and Thursday. Unless if you are working, try not to schedule your classes all on the same days, especially your first year. The reason being is you're gonna wanna skip, and when you do skip you'll find yourself skipping ALL the courses. Scheduling two courses a day gives you an even flow for college with breaks in between. 
2. Understand how your classes work and how YOU work. Some classes mark participation points and can take a heavy toll on your grade. Other classes don't count participation but offer a lot of material. Use these to your advantage and make sure when you skip classes you know the repercussions. 
3. You're gonna be tempted to eat at the dining hall everyday and drink all the soda from the soda fountain, but pace yourself. Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza. GET A MINI FRIDGE. PUT SOME SALADS IN IT. BUY FUCKING WATER. 
4. Toilet paper is a necessity you won't think about until you run out of it. In the even that you do run out and don't have cash to spare most dorms have a public bathroom in their lobby and usually are accessible at all times. It's a pain in the ass but a good contingency plan 
5. If you're doing horrible in your classes: communicate with your professors early on. Don't just drop the class or continue to flunk. Usually professors understand that some students are going to have a hard time pacing themselves and are willing to work with you if you reach out to them early on. 
6. If you are in the middle of the semester and you feel like you're going to fail a class, speak with you academic adviser and see if you can take it pass/fail. Usually you need a legitimate reason for this (disability, sickness, financial troubles), but showing your academic adviser that you're serious about your goals will make them more willing to help you
7. Remember not everyone has the stereotypical college experience as you see in movies and TV, and that not every college experience is the same. Personally I had to take breaks in between semesters, transfer my courses to a different university, change majors a few times, take part time courses, take summer courses, work part time and go to school full time, and work full time and go to school full time. College should be taken at your own pace based on YOUR needs. If you can't afford it, its okay to take a break and work to save up the money. If you realize you aren't in the right path, its OK to change majors. ",77,651,321.0865541500543,college

Professor LOST my final exam,"So I’m a 4.0 student in uni. I received a D on my final grade for an anthropology class, and was incredibly distressed and worried how this could’ve happened.
I immediately emailed my professor asking why I received this grade, a week later he responded that I never handed in the final!

It was a written take home final, I drove all the way to school and turned it in personally to him in his office on the due date, per his instructions. I bet if they checked the cameras they’d see me walking to his office, as I remember the day and time I was there. 

I emailed him back saying I was there and handed it to him personally. And followed up with an attachment of my exam. Honestly this is why all professors should utilize online submission 🙄

The only conclusive thing is that he had to have lost my final exam. Im totally fuming! What should I do if he refuses to go back and look for my exam or change my grade? ",46,645,517.4927231315357,college

Why does it seem like so many people are so anxious and depressed?,"Hello everyone, hope you are all having a fun finals week.

&#x200B;

I have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit.  As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.

&#x200B;

I know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.

&#x200B;

I just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling? There's just a lot going on in life right now and so much different things to think about it and I just wonder how people balance it or maintain a balanced mindset.

I feel like colleges are scamming students with low-effort teaching. What can we do about it?,"This subject, I’m sure, gets us all teeming with anger. 

And the sad part is: almost all university students have been there.

When you are at University you are paying hundreds of dollars for a credit hour. I am a resident of the state my university is in, so I pay $212 for a credit hour; when I have to take a typical three credit class I am paying $636 for a class; times five for a fifteen credit semester and that comes out to $3,180. For an out of state student that means you are going to pay $10,608 for a semester and $2,151 for one credit-hour class. 

When you have a terrible teacher that’s some bullshit. 

So that’s why I am asking: where is the accountability for teachers? I know there are teacher reviews at the end of the semester but what use is that when you have already paid for the semester and have learned nothing? Why do teachers with bad reps amongst the student body continue to teach? 

Students, why are we just letting this happen? 

And what can we do to stop it?

I want to call out my university, The University of Florida, out on some bullshit. Why are these teachers who put no effort into their classes allowed to teach? 

I want to do something but I don’t know what you should do to effectively end this!

My guide to a 4.0,"**Background:**

I graduated somewhat recently in physics and applied maths with a cumulative GPA of 4.00. I've seen a lot of posts here on r/college over the last few years of people freaking out over their grades and/or looking for advice on how to do well, and maybe some of what I've learnt could help others. Obviously, this stuff is aimed towards STEM since that's all I really know, but general tips map over to the humanities. These tips are in no particular order, just whatever comes into my head. Most are probably (very) obvious, and it's long. I've also TA'd for numerous classes, so if you have more specific questions r.e. maths or physics study or heading into grad for either, I can answer in comments or PM. This is certainly not an exclusive list, it's just a general one.

tldr: 

 - Go to class

 - Pay attention in class

 - Do the work

 - Put effort into the work

 - Plan ahead

 - Read the goddamn syllabus

 - Get help early

 - If you need accommodations, get them

 - Be nice to the professor

 - Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc

 - Study to the tests/exams

 - Don't say you'll do better ""next time""

 - Know how you learn best

 - Have your priorities straight

 - Be prepared to let it all go


--------

**Go to class**.

It shouldn't need to be said, but there it is. Even if the class is boring as all hell and you think you already know it all, go anyway. Some classes take attendance, some give pop-quizzes, some offer extra material not available online or in any recordings/notes, but it's just a good idea to be present regardless. Our brains form associations really quickly, so you'll learn better in the lecture hall that you always learn in rather than sitting at the desk you regularly play computer games at. You'll also be able to ask for clarification in real time, which no recording or personal study will ever afford you. Plus, it gets you in the professors good books, or at least helps keep you out of the bad books. That's incredibly important. 

**Pay attention in class**.

Once you're there, you need to actually listen. No browsing on your phone, no checking twitter on your laptop, no chatting with your neighbours, and no work from other classes. You should be paying such ardent attention that you are exhausted at the end of a 1-hour lecture. You will undoubtedly fail occasionally, but you need to force yourself to refocus every time. Do whatever you have to in order to keep paying attention. For me, that meant always taking notes by hand even if notes were printed and handed out to us by the professor before class. I never revised by my own notes, but it was important to take them anyway. The more effort you put in to learning it the first time around, the less work you need to do outside of class.

**Do the work**.

Again, should be pretty clear why, but this is the biggest reason why people fail IME. It's actually really *hard* to fail a class if you give every assignment a proper try and hand them all in on time. Even if you know you've left it way too late and can't possibly get it completed, a half-assed 50% is magnitudes better than a 0%. 

**Put effort into the work**.

Never hand in any piece of assessment as ""good enough"". Your final-copy 5-page assignment in maths should originally be a 20-page draft when you include your additional derivations and long-working. Don't skip steps: it doesn't make you look smarter, it just makes mistakes easier. I will happily expand out factors term by term if it avoids a mistake. Do your work neatly and follow standards in setup/layout. Chicken-scratch ramblings don't get a prize; the less pleasant your work is to mark, the less lenient markers will be. Remember that there is a human marking your work, so intersperse the maths with some words explaining what you're doing and why. You can still be awarded marks for correct reasoning even if you make a foolish mathematical error somewhere. This also applies to exams and tests: if you make a mistake somewhere but can't find it or don't have time to fix it, make a note of it on the paper. If you really run out of time, list the steps you *would* have taken. That'll get you something too. Also do sanity checks on your results: you've probably made a mistake if the ball is travelling faster than c.

**Plan ahead**. 

Life is shitty, and shitty things happen unexpectedly. Maybe your car breaks down, maybe your neighbours keep you up with loud music all night, maybe your dog is sick, maybe your computer fails spectacularly, maybe the power gets cut off, and maybe you just plain forget something. Have reasonable contingencies for these sorts of events. Leave a little earlier to account for any delays in travel, finish your work a day or two earlier, keep backups in multiple places, email yourself copies of important documents, set copious alarms, and have some kind of planner. Know when difficult weeks are coming up and start things earlier than usual to reduce workload later on. Being organised is probably the *most important* thing you can do to ensure success. Your memory and ability to react quickly and reasonably to complex situations is really not that great, so craft these safety nets ahead of time. It's enough to simply have a plan that you are aware of. Fix problems *before* they are problems. 

**Read the goddamn syllabus**.

Don't get caught out by participation marks after you've already missed half of the lectures. Know how much different sections are worth and roughly when they are due (some due dates may change). Be aware of minimum requirements, especially for lab classes. All of my classes had rules that you had to get >45% in all of the lab, homework, and exam portions in order to pass the class. If you got 70% overall but 40% in the lab portion, too bad - you fail. A syllabus is not a legally binding contract, but they are quite important nonetheless. Also, **keep the syllabus**. Partly in case you need to dispute something, but also, in some situations when transferring credits, universities will ask for the syllabus from your classes to judge equivalency. They are usually required to be from the correct semester/year as well IME, so no sneakily grabbing a newer one.

**Get help early**.

If you struggle to understand something in week 1, get help for it in week 1. Not week 2 and not week 13, *week 1*. Your problem with the content doesn't go away once the class moves on, it just starts festering under the surface and jeopardising everything you learn past that point. This also applies to mental health or other extreme personal circumstances. Professors and administrators can do a lot to help you early on in semester with medical withdrawals and the like, but they can't do much at all to help past a certain point. Don't look at asking for help as ""begging"", but rather as taking agency over your own learning and your own life, and recognising when you need more information/support to work at your best. You cannot control what happens to you, but you *can* control how you deal with it. 

**If you need accommodations, get them**.

If you know you have ADHD or are prone to mental illness like Depression, get the required documentation and get accommodations from your university. It isn't some dick-measuring contest to see how long you can go without your meds and there's no gold star for foregoing all treatment. University life is *tough* for a lot of people. If you try to go it alone and fail, *you* are the one who suffers from that sort of hubris. I had accommodations for issues with concentration and processing speed. My internals and labs were great, but my early tests were consistently 20% lower; having accommodations simply levelled the playing field and made my grades more regular. Real life is not like an exam and you do not need to sit under the same conditions. If you need an extra 30 minutes or a quiet room to work in, get it. Having these accommodations can also help with requests for extensions or leniency in marking if you suddenly fall ill. It certainly saved my ass a few times. 

**Be nice to the professor**.

(Assuming they're a reasonable human being, of course) In many classes, the professor has a lot of power. They set the rules of their class and they are also free to bend those rules as they see fit. If the professor likes you, they may give you an extension when you're stressed out or simply forget homework, will invest more time and energy into your learning, offer you extra opportunities in their field, act as great letter writers later on, and simply be a great addition to your network. Many of the things I achieved during undergrad came from my contacts with professors, who then pointed me towards friends with good opportunities in national labs and prestigious universities. The person with the personal contact wins every time. 

**Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc**.

Professors are actually kinda clueless when it comes to the running of the department, but the local head administrator knows all. Befriend the person who's actually in charge and you'll never be stuck in endless loops of administration bullshit ever again. Hiring opportunities inside *and* outside of the department flow through this person first, as do many applications afterwards. Forms you need to fill out will pass this point as well, and they are often the ones with a tight hold on the money-strings. They also know their equivalent in other departments, and can get you priority meetings/appointments. They are typically well-known and very well-liked, and their seal of approval on you carries weight. 

**Study to the tests/exams**.

Don't do 100 problems out of a dusty textbook your professor has never used as the format and method of solution will be slightly different. When you're first learning something, using multiple distinct methods can throw you off and you gain nothing from the exercise. Look at previous exams if available through your library to get a feel for the general format, as questions tend to be similar over the years. If these are not available, then use previous questions set to you or other questions from the same pool. Study strategically to match. 

**Don't say you'll do better ""next time""**.

So many of my friends would get 60% in an assignment, brush it off immediately, and say they'd just make up for it next week. They never did. Assume your grades will *decline* over the course of the semester as you become stressed and burnt out, so put effort in early. If you get a poor mark, organise to discuss your mistakes with the professor ASAP. For the next assignment, ask to have it checked a day or two *before* you submit it. Professors and TAs are usually more than happy to review drafts of substantial work before submission, you just need to ask and be willing to hear criticism. It is not an attack on your character, they are literally just telling you what you need to do to earn a higher grade by the rubric they have. 

**Know how you learn best**.

If you do your best work between 7pm-9pm, then save tough things for that time. If you find it hard to get up and pay attention in 8am classes, try to avoid signing up for classes at that time. If you know which professors teach to the style you like to learn in, take their section if available and suitable. But always be reassessing these methods. If the evidence of your results isn't backing up your statements, you need to figure out what's going wrong and fix it ASAP. Keep your fingers on the pulse at all times and be ready to adapt. 

**Have your priorities straight**.

Know how important your grades are to you from the beginning and stick to that. After a terrible run in high school, I decided that I wouldn't settle for any kind of mediocrity and whenever I lost focus, I reminded myself of that goal. Don't say that you want top grades and then act completely opposite to that statement. But don't go too far the other way either: if you get to the end of your degree and have nothing but a 4.0, then you've wasted a lot of your time. You need to have experience in your field and other things going for you. Know what is important/necessary and what is not for your specific goals and living situation. If you need a supermarket job to pay the bills, keep it. If you really don't need the money, find something more constructive and relevant to do with your time. 

**Be prepared to let it all go**.

Getting ""good"" grades is a matter of effort, planning, and natural aptitude in some measure. Graduating with a 4.0 specifically is pure luck. Even a headache on the day of an important exam can send things down the drain, and no matter how well you plan ahead, random events *will* affect you. I failed in plenty of the above tips over the last 3 years. I skipped out on weeks of classes because I thought I knew everything, I didn't plan ahead properly and had horrible all-nighters, I tried to get through without disability accommodations, I allowed myself to get so ill as to not hand in assignments, and I crammed for exams. Blind luck and the curve pulled me through every time, but it could easily not have. Finishing with a 4.0 is nice, getting that sweet medal is cool, but it means next to nothing the day after grades are released. After you land that first position, it really won't mean anything at all. Keep the achievement in perspective and don't lose sight of the things that really matter at this point in your life, whatever that point is. But if you want that 4.0 just as a personal goal and keep sight of everything else, don't let people dissuade you from it or convince you that you should care less. If you want to set the bar high, make sure it's feasible but then hold yourself to it. ",80,630,655.6562995204247,college
Community College is NOT Always the Best Option.,"I’ve seen a lot of people here suggest that if you don’t go to community college for two years, you are making a stupid decision since there are absolutely no downsides. According to them, every single person should go to community college first.

Community college can be an amazing option for many people, but it is NOT as black and white as many of you make it seem.

Here are just some potential negatives of going to community college

- If you want to go in to a field that values prestige (say, finance) you will have a very difficult time getting internships your first two summers. In fact, most big banks now recruit Junior summer interns during their sophomore spring, so make that your first three summers. That will seriously impact career prospects out of school. Also, contrary to what some may adamantly say, almost every field values prestige to an extent. 

- Even if you only want to apply for an internship Junior year, employers will likely not like the fact that you only have a semester (or less) of grades to show at your school.

- Networking is an important part of college. You are missing out on a lot of important opportunities to cultivate friendships your first two years if you aren’t even there until Junior year.

- Will be very difficult to gain leadership positions in student organizations coming in as a third year.

So, the reality is, Community Colleges are an invaluable asset to many students, but there ARE downsides. I feel that students are being misled by people on here claiming that there is absolutely no reason to not go to community college.

The 3 types of professors,"All professors can be divided into one of three categories.

Finally there is the slacker:
This miserable bastard is at the school for one reason. They want to indulge in a life of research and will (begrudgingly) spend a semester milking a class for tuition money with a bare bones, half assed curriculum. ",60,624,260.62158887227656,college
Does anyone else feel like some students make college a lot harder than it really is?,"*So before I go further into this post, college can be super challenging and different schools/majors require a different workload.  I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*

In high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.

Edit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.  Once again the purpose of this post was to share how I feel over thinking and elitist culture affects students.",143,622,183.7594129463506,college

What to do when a professor refuses to accommodate student disabilities????,"I have a learning disability--I have a pretty severe stutter and an auditory processing disorder, so I go through my community college's Disability Center to get academic accommodations that allow me:

\*extra time on exams

\*a note-taker

\*recordings of lectures

\*reduced weight on public speaking assignments (because of the stutter)

&#x200B;

I have a professor who has completely refused to accommodate this. No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because ""your notes should be your own"". No recordings of lectures because ""I don't want to be put on Youtube"". No reduced weight on public speaking because ""your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack"". 

&#x200B;

So, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter.

&#x200B;

I have a lot of classes and a lot of finals, multiple back to back and classes I need to do well in, so I spend all my time studying. I'll do that homework Friday afternoon, as I have 3 back to back to back finals that day, including this computer science course.

&#x200B;

So I take the exams, do the homework, turn it all in, and go about my day.

Suddenly, my final grade comes back as a D. Apparently 'end of finals week' meant 'end of this class', as in friday morning. I missed 15% of a final grade of piss-easy homework because of this.

Professor raised a concern that I might have plagiarized my last paper,"In one my classes (I don't want to risk someone from her looking back in my post history to figure out it's me so I won't say the subject but I will say it's a gen ed class) we recently had to write a research paper. We picked the topic and had to make a at minimum 5 page paper using 4 sources (1 having to be a psychical book) that we found. 

The papers were assigned at the beginning of the semester and we were allowed to resubmit the paper to get a better grade (if we chose). Last week on Monday I submitted my copy of the paper to see what my professor thought and to see what needed to be worked on it. He handed back papers yesterday (Monday the 15th) and asked me to stay after class to talk with him, I am doing well in the class (B/A or 3.5) so I didn't think anything of it and that maybe he just wanted to discuss a critique in person to get his point across. 

He handed me my paper and said ""the language and style you used in this paper is not something I normally see out of a college student, like this wasn't typed out by a person if you know what I mean, it doesn't feel or look right to me, I am not going to jump to any conclusions but my two thoughts are either you plagiarized this paper or your a really above average writer."" I was shocked, speechless actually. Some backstory (if this helps at all) I wrote a another paper for the same class and professor earlier in the semester and got a 4.0 on it, same language of writing, same style of writing, same everything. 

He gave me the paper back and said ""here, look it over and see what you can do to it, I don't really want to report you for plagiarism or give a 0 for this assignment.""

I took the paper back and took it home with me, stared at it and was just like ""what the fuck was that?""

I reviewed the paper for plagiarism on Grammarly and it came back with a 4% match, I am so confused now.

What did my professor see that I didn't? Is my writing style really that ""odd""

I'd like to hear what you guys/gals think.",47,611,181.40782729820245,college

I overslept through my 8AM Chemistry,"I hope this doesn’t sound too stupid, but this morning I overslept through my chemistry class that starts at 8. I’ve never had a problem with this in the past, but this morning I woke up at 8:45 and the class ends at 9:15. I felt that it was not worth going, as by the time I had gotten to the class it would’ve been over. 

I thought it would be best to email her and apologize for missing lecture, and that I look forward to next class. However, I’m worried that this will look worse on me, considering I didn’t miss a test or a quiz. I have also already gotten the notes from class today.

My professors attendance policy is that there are no make-up quizzes, make up tests for excused absences, and that regular attendance is expected.

Is it worth emailing my professor at this point, or should I just move on?",60,599,6.5533249833876335,college
Am I wrong for not wanting my roommate to have his boyfriend over the room during finals week?,"Just for background, my roommate went through a rough breakup over the summer, and it truly brought out the worst in him. He skipped class in order to sleep in all day. He self-harmed. He became desperate for companionship and tried to pursue relationships not only with borderline strangers, but also members of our close-knit friend group. All in all, it was a very uncomfortable thing to witness all year.

&#x200B;

Recently, he's met a guy on Tinder from the next state over, and things have been moving fast for them. They're planning on meeting up, barring the difficulties that come from the fact that neither of them have cars never mind their licenses. Overall, I'm happy for him, if not for one thing; numerous times when they call, my roommate has repeatedly said that they're guaranteed to have the room to themselves whenever they want, and that he has no issue kicking me out. 

&#x200B;

If it were at any other point in the semester, I really wouldn't mind and I would happily give them their privacy. But this upcoming Monday marks the first day of finals week. I don't so much mind giving them a couple of hours to themselves as I could just go to the library, but I'm not keen on sleeping at a friend's room the night before a final.

&#x200B;

Any advice on how to talk to my roommate about it? I basically want to affirm that I am genuinely happy that he found someone new, but I'm not about to place his relationship before my final grades.",46,598,172.47786202042468,college

My Roommate Keeps bringing over a guy and it’s too much now..,"Okay so to basically sum up how this started, the first time she brought him over was apparently to do some kind of interview thing for one of her classes and she had asked me to leave, but it was more along the lines of “yeah, you’re going to have to get out soon”. I didn’t care at first since I was going out to eat with some kids on my floor in my dorm, but when I got back to the room at 2am he was still there..asleep on her bed. 

I didn’t exactly shrug it off and expressed my concerns hoping I wouldn’t have to have another situation like that...until the next day when she brings him over again while I’m trying to help a friend with some chemistry work and guess what, he slept over again. This is two times she’s brought him over without letting me know and with no time to prepare I couldn’t find the right time to go shower or get changed. I told her once again if she could let me know when she is bringing people over. She said ok.

Tonight though.. I walk in and see him shirtless getting a massage from one of her friends while they talk about having a threesome but she said she wouldn’t because she’s una loyal relationship. I was hoping they would leave after watching the movie so I could finish my work but..they’re sleeping over and this is now the 3rd time in a row that she has let this happen without telling me ahead of time that she was having people over, sleeping over at that. And now there is a shirtless guy that I’m not exactly comfortable with because I don’t know him in our shared room and another girl in the room as well. I’m fed up with it and I don’t know where to go from here. 

tl;dr: Roommate brings random guy over 3rd time in a row without telling me in advance. He always ends up sleeping over.

Edit: Thank you everyone for giving me some advice on to what I should do. I’ll start talking to her about it.",68,598,39.95579026116541,college
Can you ask a professor to talk to a student who keeps interrupting class?,"In one of my classes, there is a woman I will call Jane. Jane is in her 60s and is attending classes at my university through a program that allows seniors to take courses for free, basically for fun (they can’t earn a degree through this program). It has been my experience that these students tend to be more talkative and less aware of classroom etiquette, which is understandable because they haven’t been in school in a long time. It has never been a problem for me in any other classes. 

Jane is different. She interrupts constantly. Our professor is laid back, he tells lots of jokes and anecdotes and allows open discussion. But she cuts into literally almost every sentence he says, she interrupts other students when they are talking, she completely derails conversations with her own unrelated stories or questions. She makes inappropriate jokes while the professor is trying to teach. She “whispers” very loudly to the students around her during lectures. She’s not being malicious, she just doesn’t seem to understand when it’s not appropriate for her to be talking - she thinks she’s the class clown making everyone laugh with her outbursts and jokes but they usually just make everyone annoyed and uncomfortable (for example, she makes many jokes about finding the young black men in our class to be really hot every time they talk - she’s an old white woman). She’s very disruptive and the class is moving at a snail’s pace mainly due to her interruptions, but shockingly the professor has done nothing other than shoot her annoyed looks from time to time. 

Sorry for the long background, but my question is, would it be wrong for me to ask him to talk to her? She’s not just annoying me, she’s actually hurting our ability to learn in this class. Other students have been complaining about the same things. I’m not saying she shouldn’t be allowed to join discussions or ask questions, I just want him to ask her to tone it down or be more considerate about how much class time she takes up/allowing other students to talk. But I don’t know if that is inappropriate or if it would make me an asshole. I don’t want to form a bad reputation with this professor. Should I talk to him or just suck it up?

My Grades Do Not Reflect My Effort or Confidence,"Midterms absolutely rocked me. I was an A+ student in high school. I was going strong with all my projects, homework, lab reports, etc. I studied hours every day. I went into my midterms with complete confidence. But two of my midterms were shockingly below average. A 71% in Calculus and a 64% in Chem. It's not an unfixable situation, but I don't know what I did wrong. Walking into and out of the exam room, I felt completely confident in getting an A. I had studied a week in advance for both tests. I went into office hours frequently. I pay attention during lecture. I do the homework. I don't understand what I did wrong?

I'm not asking for a miracle solution. I just want tips from people who may have been in the same situation.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who gave helpful comments (which is just about everyone). I'm writing down everything you guys are telling me and preparing for my Chem midterm next week.

Edit #2: I took another Chem Midterm and got a 90. I took a lot of the advice on here to heart. I prepared a week in advance, so I had questions for my recitation teacher.

Edit: Thank you for the input everyone!! I stood awkwardly around the half-open door (trying to gauge if I there was a seat in the back I could slip into before entering).

Weed use among students makes me incompatible,"This is a problem I've been dealing with for a while now.

While I've smoked weed before, I disassociate really badly and it isn't a good experience. So I don't smoke, and don't plan on it

Unfortunately, weed culture makes up a lot of what people do socially. This leads to me being an outlier, and being really different from most students. I've struggled to find friends or dates where it doesn't end up with them trying to get high.

UNCOMMON college tips for continuing students and incoming freshman/transfer,"So I know there are a lot of post that give tips about college, academically and socially. A decent amount of those post mention a lot of the same tips/advice. After almost getting done with my junior year of college I thought I shared some tips that I don’t see on here often and just stuff to expect that most people wouldn’t(applies mainly for incoming freshman or CC transfers to uni). If any of you have any tips that aren’t super common, ex; joining clubs, studying, don’t skip class, etc., definitely comment to help out others.

1. Making a legit calendar or journal that you plan to follow saves so much stress in the long run. I see people with planners a lot but they mainly just use it to write down as a  “what to do” when ever they plan to do assignments, studying, etc., If you actually sit plan specific date and time for certain things college will go very smooth. This helps me mainly because I work and am a dj outside of college. My schedule gets crazy and I used to stress but immediately when I started doing the date and time process, things got so less stressful.

2. It’s okay to say “fuck it” a few weekends of the semester and just enjoy life rather than studying or doing college work. This may seem like bad advice but everything is good in moderation. Sometimes you just wanna say screw it and lounge around all weekend or go hang with your friends all weekend. As long as you don’t have a midterm or a major exam early in the next week, I think it’s okay and healthy to have this mentality here and there.

3. Greek life is not what everyone thinks it is.... this one is pretty common and everyone really does have their own personal experiences with fraternities/sororities so I’ll just say that Greek life for me personally was a drama oriented waste of my time. I’m not gonna sit here and say their is no benefits of Greek life because there definitely is.

4. This is the main reason I actually made this post but for all of us who didn’t have the “best” high school/past experiences, people end up talking about high school a lot more than you think they would. After being a looser, burnout, Loner type of kid, I was really excited about college because people make it seem like none of that stuff matters. Well when I got to my uni, it was not how I imagined. People talk about high school a lot but it’s mainly because thats their past and they don’t know what else to talk about and you can’t really blame them. People used to tell me “this is just a early college thing”, it’s not I’m friends with tons of upper level undergrad and even grad students that are always bringing up the good ole days. I am left out of many conversations because of this but at this point, I don’t really care anymore because that’s just life. It does suck but you have to get over it at some point.

So that’s it but definitely comment if you have any other tips or experiences that aren’t posted on this sub often. Also feed back would be great especially on 4",121,574,186.58242220560984,college
My professor hates me (advice plz),"My biochem lab professor absolutely hates me. It’s a small lab of 10 people and everyone in that lab told me that he doesn’t like me. On the first day of class he screwed up a problem on the board and I raised my hand and asked him why he did it that way then when he explained it I told him respectfully that the way he did the question is incorrect. He did not realize what was wrong so I had to walk him through it step by step on the board, which I get made him embarrassed and look like an idiot in front of the class but it’s not my fault he did the problem wrong. Since that day he has hated me. He consistently grades me harsher than all my peers and takes off points for things that others didn’t lose points for. 

Last week he screwed up an answer key for a quiz and when I told him that the key is wrong and proved to him that my answer is correct he refused to give me the points back, instead he said “I’ll just throw that question out. ” 

On another instance he took off points because he claimed I had not included my pKa value in my notebook, when I showed it to him that it was on the next page he refused to give me the points back claiming that I should’ve circled it. 


Another thing that happened today. He took off points for my notebook because he claimed I didn’t include my data. When I showed him it in my notebook he claimed that I wrote in after he handed back the notebooks. Then I showed him the same data on another page that he had also commented he was like ok and gave me back 1 of the two points. Then I asked why only 1 of the 2 then he said ok fine and gave me back both points. 

He huffed and it was one of the rudest encounters ever tbh.

Is it ethical/legal for a college to create a new required course 2 weeks before someone’s final semester before graduation begins?,"My college added an extra 1 credit course that will consist only of materials to take the college exit exam.

Are Online Classes Supposed To Be This Bad?,"It's my first year of college and I have three in real life classes and two online. The second one hasn't started yet but the first is Intro to Psych. I took it as a class in high school and it was my favorite. Now, with the online class, our entire course is just reading the textbook. Genuinely my entire syllabus is every week we read a chapter of the textbook and summarize it. Then we have to reply to two other students summaries with some kind of response even though we're all describing the same thing. She'll occasionally throw in a three page essay on a 15 minute video like Little Albert. Are online classes supposed to be this horrible?

Failing my classes and confused about my major/future,"I am currently a second year student at a California community college. I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.

So this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don’t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. 

I don’t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that’s my parents’ money. I’m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won’t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don’t think I can do. Any advice will help, I’m extremely stressed right now.

Edit: Thank you for all the thorough replies! I’m going to see a counselor and will likely withdraw from physics and calc, stay in chem and find a job.",57,549,7.381218501906152,college

And rightfully so, college, as well as any transition can be frightening and come with a host of problems.  But with the new year about to start, and the sub being filled with rising freshman, I wanted to hear from the people that are enjoying their experience so far.

As for myself, I am a Junior and college has allowed me to discover that I love chemistry ( ironic because I hated it in high school.) While I'm definitely not a social butterfly, I have made a few friends and in general I'm loving my college experience. I do have some fears, mostly about debt, but I'm looking forward to going back and I don't regret going to college or picking my major.

Fit students: how do you fit in gym time as a busy student?,"I’m a 20 year old guy and I’d like to start building muscle. I was never the sporty type and I was nearing obesity until a little over a year and a half ago, when I started dieting and walking more. I’ve dropped 100 pounds, and now I have a dad bod. I mean to say, I’m very new to all of this.


I have a part time job (~25 hours a week), and I’m heavily involved in a theater club and a volunteering club, which together take up about 10 hours of my week. I’m taking 16 credits, and I’m dumb so I have to study a lot to maintain good grades. Any free time I have is spent socializing or napping.


The gym is 15 minutes away, which means 30 minutes are taken up just by travel. Showering takes about 10 minutes, and if 40 minutes of my day are spent just doing those I’d prefer to spend more than 20 minutes at the gym. Is working out on Saturday and Sunday mornings worth it? Will it at least somewhat help tone my body? Weekends are usually spent just relaxing and studying, but since exercise helps mental health, I can trade out relaxing with gym time I guess.


(Inb4 someone suggests getting my own weights: my room is a shoebox and weirdly shaped. I don’t have enough room to extend my arms fully or to do pushups. I don’t want to exercise in our living room while everyone is studying...)

What’s the worst professor you’ve ever had? What’s the best?,"What did they do to make them the best or worst?

**edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in.  I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus.  I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus.  The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide.  I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it.  I was very grateful towards them.  The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class.  The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week.  He refused, told me to not be lazy and to ""hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you"" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr.  I didn't need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn't have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway..... I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was.  I've since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn't even a good teacher to begin with.

**worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero.  At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. 

**best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.

I ended up switching majors from cs to math/stats, partially as a result of these two teachers.",111,498,46.514783316720965,college

My God, none of the classes there were good but night classes had to be the most sad thing I've experienced. Everybody just seems zapped of energy. To make things worst, I took the class that met once a week for THREE HOURS both times!

&#x200B;

And one of the classes pretty much just consisted of the teacher standing up there and talking (it was an intro. to business class and the only tests we had were open-note online quizzes). I pretty much just browsed the web the entire class. The other one was a macroeconomics class (I took AP macro in high school so I guess second time taking it in a way) where we actually had formal tests but got study guides we went over in class. I paid attention more in that class than I did in intro. to business but also spent most of it just surfing the web.

&#x200B;

For the record, I got As in both classes so my grade didn't suffer at all in either of the classes from not paying attention.

The worst was at the end of the macro class when my teacher was like, yeah, the department thought it was important for you to write a research paper to make sure you understand what economics is. I don't understand it and frankly don't really expect you to be able to forecast what's going to happen in economics in the future. So for this paper I'm just going to grade you on your mechanics, spelling and format, sentence flow etc. You need to include graphs but I don't care if those are accurate or if what you write is accurate because I think this paper is silly in the first place.

I have classes I like and I feel like I'm doing my work and I'm not stressed academically. I also have a good friend group at school. However, I just feel like I lost a piece of myself since coming to college?

I was very passionate about certain things before college, but my passion has almost completely went away. I don't have a problem motivating myself to do my work and I finish them on time, but when I don't feel passionate? I just do the work to do it and I don't feel like I'm getting at better or anything. I also struggle getting the drive and energy to do hobbies. I either just lie in bed or chill with friends when I'm not doing hw, which isn't bad, but I feel like I should also be taking care of my hobbies since it was something I cared so much about before. Not sure if that makes sense, but its been on my mind a lot.

Edit: I didn't expect this to get this many comments and I appreciate what was said. I think despite my great friend group I feel like I'm not ready to spill these emotions about my lack of sense of self to them. And it would feel weird talking to friends from high school, despite still being very close, because they are so far away and doing such different things. I only have my boyfriend who I went to high school with and a close RA on campus to talk to about these problems I feel. I think being over a 1000 miles away from home magnified this disconnect I feel with my home and life before college. My hobbies are also related to the arts which I feel like are taken less seriously. The arts used to be my main source of inspiration and ambition before college and it felt like it was fading after college, but I think I'm realizing that my relationship with the arts is changing and whether I pursue it or not, I'll be okay.

"[19f] Assigned 3 male roommates for my student living apartment, any advice?","So last night I received my roommate assignment for my student living apartment and I have 3 male roommates (presumably, one name could be female but it's unlikely). The email only gave me their first name and their phone number, so I can't look them up on Facebook. When I was living in a dorm I lived with a good female friend of mine, so having 3 complete strangers be my roommate is a little scary. Luckily I got my top choice of room and floor preference, and I have my own bathroom. We also each have deadbolts on our bedrooms doors in addition to the front door of the apartment.

Finals tips from a senior,"1. Bring healthy snacks with you to the library/wherever you study. I can almost guarantee that you will be there longer than you think you will. Snacks from the vending machine and fast food won’t help you in your long run studying. Unhealthy foods weigh you down and make it harder to focus. 
 
2. Study in the building or even classroom where your exam is if you can 

3. Set a timer on your phone for 90 and take a lap when it goes off. The movement will help you focus more. 

4. You have time for a shower, take one. 

5.  Utilize your school’s tutoring/academic assistance centers. I work at mine, and very few people use it during finals. Go and get help from people who are paid to help you. 

6. Stop studying by midnight each night. If you’re up studying until 2 am with a final the next day, prioritize sleep. You don’t want to cram everything in the night before then fall asleep during the exam. 

7. If you have a cumulative final, make a cheat sheet for each chapter/section on the exam of the highlights of that part. 

8. If you’re in a math or economics course, draw out all of the graphs you know you’ll be tested on.

9. Make a formulas cheat sheet to review right before the exam. 

10. 15 minutes before the exam, head to the exam room. If you don’t know it 15 minutes before, you aren’t going to know it. Take a few minutes to breathe slowly and calm yourself down. 

11. If you’re writing an essay, take the number of required pages, multiply it by 2, then have that many paragraphs. Ex) if you have a 6 page paper on the economic impacts of affirmative action in higher education admission decisions like I did, write out the 10 biggest points you want to hit then add a conclusion and introduction. 

12. Break your studying in to small chunks of no more than 2 hours for each subject at a time 

13. Don’t have more than 4 cups of coffee in a day, you won’t be able to concentrate 

14. If you don’t study well in the library, try an academic building, the clubhouse at your apartment complex, sorority/fraternity house, or administrative buildings on campus. There probably won’t be many people using those spaces to study. 

15. If you have a short answer/essay test, write out notes for all of the questions then go back and do your long written out answer.

What I tell incoming Freshman every year: good grades and a party life are not mutually exclusive. The key is your routine & habit (Very long-winded post).,"**Good grades and a party life are not mutually exclusive.**

Since many people are about to go to college, I wanted to share my experience in Undergrad and Law School. More specifically, I wanted to address what I think is the most important thing about university life – **Routine & Habit**. 

I’ve counseled for incoming Freshman for a few years now as a graduate student and I get very positive feed back from the students who follow the advice I am about to give. 

Quickly, I’ll brag. I graduated with top Latin honors with a 4.0 in my major and 3.9+ in my minors. I also went out and had fun and partied 3-4+ nights per week. Senior year I was going out almost every night and traveling every weekend. I had an amazing time at undergrad filled with success, opportunity, and memories with the people who are now my best and life-long friends. Here is how:

 .

1. **Establish A Routine & Study Habits.**

High school and college differ substantially in a critical way – routine. Very few high schools allow their students to create schedules that don’t adhere to their own. Maybe you picked some of your own classes, but most students still went to school every day from 8am to 3pm (or whatever times you did). College is different. You may have 3 classes one day with 2 hour breaks between them and 1 evening class the next. After having spent the past 12 years of your life in the 8am to 3pm school routine, you will now need to find a new routine. This is easily the hardest part and can take nearly a full semester to establish. 

Most freshmen arrive at college and bask in the glory of getting to sleep in late, taking breaks between classes, and not having any parents around to enforce curfews. After 12 years of grade school you’re finally free of that rigid routine and it feels GREAT! I’m not trying to say that you’ve got to maintain that strict rigidity of high school and live in misery every day of college. In fact, I will tell you that establishing a good routine will make your college experience far more fulfilling and fun-filled than those who do not. 

So what does a good routine look like? Some of that is subjective, you need to determine what you prefer. My ideal routine may not sound like yours. But I do say with confidence these three things: 1) Establish a study spot that is not your living quarters; 2) visit that study spot daily; and **3) if you want to be a party person, you need to be a morning person.**

For me, I woke up every day at 8ish and went to a nearby coffee shop/lounge. Every weekday morning for me started with a cup of coffee there and I would prepare, read, write, etc.. for my classes that day or beyond. If I didn’t have any work, I’d try to get a head a little, plan, organize, or find work (clubs, organizations, applications for internships, study abroad, etc..) The coffee shop was my “office” and when I wasn’t in class or at lunch, I was at the coffee shop. 

It took almost a full semester for this to become habit and for me to stop struggling to get up and force myself to go. But, once it was my routine it was like Pavlov’s bell. I was immediately put into study mode because I was in that spot I dedicated only for my studies. This is why I believe a dorm room doesn’t work, because you share that space with too many other activities and this can make it harder to ‘click’ into that study mode when needed. 

**Treat your studies like a 9-5 job** (or 8-4 like I preferred). During the day you’re either at your study spot, lunch, or class. It isn’t as miserable as it sounds. I had friends I’d see at the coffee shop; I’d or lay out or play on the quad during lunch, etc… It isn’t all work, enjoy your day – but remember, your day-time routine is a work routine first and foremost. 

.



**2. Be the master of your class schedule** 

Picking and prioritizing classes can be difficult. Many universities will assign incoming freshmen a ‘core curriculum’ and some even go ahead and schedule your first semester or two of classes. So you’re kinda stuck there, and this section is for all those semesters where you’ll get to pick your own classes. 

The three most important things in making a class schedule, in my opinion are (in this order): **1) The Professor**; 2) The Time/Days; 3) The subject matter. 

*First one is easy* – better professors simply offer a better classroom and learning experience. Look for professors that have high ratings on online ranking sites and also see if those professors teach classes from freshman through senior & graduate level. Getting to take that one amazing professor multiple times throughout your time is invaluable. I had to take through Calc. 2 – so 4 semesters at 1 math class each. Two professors were rated to be easy A’s in the basic class and were rated highly. However, one professor I saw was rated harder but also taught every class I needed. So I stuck with her for all 4 classes; those later 3 classes were so much easier because I was a part of this professor’s continuing curriculum, learned her style, and had built a reputation with her. 

Building a relationships with your professors is something most incoming Freshman find horrifying. I never in a million years would have dreamed of hanging out with any of my high school teachers; yet, by my senior year I knew several professors that I could (and would) get drinks with. Heck, one professor taught a “Lord of the Rings and Political Theory” class Thursday 5-8pm specifically so we could go to a bar and pre-game with him while talking about LoTR. You had to apply to get in and it was a pretty fun time (and I did learn a lot too since he assigned a ton of readings). 

*Second one is harde* – Sometimes you just cant get the classes you wanted; sometimes classes conflict with each other, etc… I only advice a few things here. First, don’t overload and try to do 6 hours in a row. I tried a semester where I did only Tuesday/Thursday classes and had Wednesday and Friday-Monday off. Maybe that’s for you, but I hated it. My ideal schedule was about 2 classes per M/W or T/R block and a once per week evening course, so 5 classes total for 15 credit hours (max at my school was 17 and minimum was 12). I cant recommend the 3 hour once-per-week classes enough. The idea of a 3 hour long 5-8pm class may sound like shit; but, often professors hate going that long (they want to go home too) and it really does make your days feel a lot more open. 

*Third is easy*  - You’ve picked your times, you’ve picked your professors. Now pick what classes fit! I know you’ll be required to take some classes, but work around that and do the best you can to tinker with your schedule until you get what you want. At my school, registration was a mad dash first-come first-serve ordeal. To prepare for this, I’d have several schedules made out and assigned all the CRNs to my copy/paste clipboard (we used banner/banweb/blackboard). Turns out, most of the time the top rated professors are also teaching the classes people want to take; so things work out pretty well outside of required core classes with this method. 

.

**3. **Finally – DON’T LET YOUR FRIENDS DISTRACT YOU!** 
**
Honestly, if you develop a morning routine like I did, this may only rarely apply to you. Most people I knew slept in late, didn’t work between classes, and planned their routines like they did in High school – they saved all their work for evenings when all the classes were done. But night is when all the fun stuff happens, so why save all your work until then?!

As things turned out – I was the bad/distracting influence on my friends. By the time 5-6 rolled around I was done with my work, hungry, and bored. So I’d go around and try to recruit a group to go out and do something. Once you get a couple of people who want to go do something fun, its easy to show up to your friend’s dorm room and say, “hey, we’re going quarry diving, lets go!” Of course they’re going to go because their current choices are to do math homework that can wait for a couple of days or get shit faced and jump off a 30 foot ledge. 

Problem so many Freshman run into is that there is ALWAYS a person like me looking to go out and do something at night. If you’re constantly putting things off to go on adventures and hit up the bars, then you’ll always been fighting to catch up later. There is always something to do and somebody to do it with in college; get your work done, then go play. It’ll make the play all the better without having that stress in the back of your mind. 

I should also note: most of the people I knew thought I was a terrible student and were under the impression that I was never studying/working because they only ever saw me go out at night, the time they used for work. A lot of people do put off all their work in favor of going out, so they just assumed I was one of those kids who was there to party, not study. People I knew for years came up to me at graduation and were shocked to see all the chords around my neck. 

I had friends busting into the coffee shop at 9 in the morning on a Tuesday looking to go crazy all day… like maybe a handful of times over the years… 

.

**TL:DR: Routine/Habit is the most important part of your college experience. Find an ‘office’ to study at and treat your studies like a 9-5 job. Pick your classes to meet YOUR routine and don’t let others tear your routine apart. All the wordiness in this post is mostly explanation and anecdotal stories to illustrate the points better.**

Crippling loneliness is ruining college for me.,"I am at a fairly large public school in Georgia, and have zero friends. Zero. I have people that I occasionally speak to, but I’d hardly consider them friends since we don’t ever speak outside of class. I’m totally, utterly, completely without someone to talk to.   I also have Asperger’s, which makes socialization doubly difficult. 
My grades are great, but it’s only because all I ever do is study. I’m transferring to another school next fall, out of state, and I really want to make some sort of turnaround when I get there. This can’t be what college is about. 
Is there anything I can do in the meantime to meet people like me, even if it’s online? I’m just so tired of having no one to talk to. It’s making me ornery and spiteful, which I know isn’t right. ",95,471,340.0925148097647,college
How do you study for courses you dislike?,"I am required to take two physics and two more math courses as part of my degree, but I strongly dislike the material and have a hard time focusing and applying myself. Whether it be doing homework or paying attention in lecture, I just can't seem to discipline myself into using that time wisely.

Perhaps I'm in the wrong faculty (science; chem major), as biology is terrible for me as well, and I'm not good at labs. In general, I enjoy chemistry (at least on paper, idrk about labs yet), but have no clue of what I'm going to do with the kinda unemployable degree. My lack of direction makes it all the more difficult for me to find motivation for courses that I actively despise.

I am also disengaged - I inevitably make countless stupid/ careless mistakes if I couldn't care less about the material, and can seldom maintain an adequate amount of focus. Hence I find it difficult to do well in such subjects. The material is not excessively challenging, but it's tough for me to succeed when I don't like what I'm doing.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks everyone.",92,473,29.30295462457946,college
Does anybody judge anybody for what they wear in college in terms of brand?,"At my highschool, kids would make fun of others for buying and wearing gap and other clothes. I happen to like gaps quality in jeans but I wore other brands instead to keep up. Well now I’m about to go clothes shopping before I go off. 

Would kids judge if I wore Gap stuff? Or even other brands, but mostly Gap? 

I know it’s weird but I’m just trying to know how college people think haha. Thank you!

EDIT** These comments are great, haha thank you all, it makes me feel much better. I grew up feeling left out so I used to try to get nicer clothes because the kids would often “check” or “roast” each other when they wore something that wasn’t Raulph Lauren or those types of shirts. I ended up liking Gap’s quality more than some of those high brands though but I just tried to fit in. I’m glad I’m hearing I can be myself in college, that’s what I’ve been looking for :)


SECOND EDIT** Woah this blew up pretty well. I just want to say thank you for all of the answers, I feel much better now. I also do want to say that I WAS NOT one of the people that judged others for what they wore. I just didn’t want to get judged. Thank you all for all of the answers though!!!

I’m just really nervous and need reassurance, did I approach this situation correctly? I just finished first year so I’m relatively new to this scenario.

Update: Professor emailed me back this morning saying that Canvas didn’t have an accurate grading system so instead of an A- I’m gonna be stuck with the B+.

Can a college professor refuse to grade future assignments?,"OP here. I've been taking an online course to catch up on my credit hours. So my college professor just stated that he will not evaluate my work further and will not grade future assignments. He says that I haven't been listening to instructions, even though I can't even find the instructions. I even asked him where the instructions are because I couldn't find them, but he simply said that because it's an online course, I should be able to do things on my own. He even told me to go ahead and drop the course. I was sitting at a B but because he hasn't been providing instructions my grades have dropped down to an F.

To get an idea of an assignment, I'd even look at what other students would post and try to follow in a related topic in the same format. But the professor stills says that it's incorrect, and gives me a zero but gives the other students a high grade. Like WTF is wrong with my professor?

The tenured professors read off the same powerpoint slides they have had for over a decade.  But it seems like all my professors do not care about educating their students or helping them understand the material.

How to deal with weird professor interaction,"Yesterday, I was taking a test and I got to a question that I had a question on.

I said ""so we are allowed to choose more than one answer for this question right?"" And the teacher just started at me and she was like ""did you read the question? Does it not say it right there? Come on it's RIGHT THERE!"" Also, she said this loud enough that the entire class heard and they started laughing. Then, she shoved my head with her hand and walked away. 

This whole experience was pretty humiliating and I was too flustered and pissed off to concentrate on the test for about 20 minutes.

Friendly Reminder: Finals are not the end of the world! You got this.,"It seems like every semester at my school, I receive the inevitable email regarding the death of a student. While not explicitly stated, the majority of these deaths, which happen to be near finals week, are suicides. 


Since I became moderator of this subreddit close to 2 years ago, and since I became a semi-active member 3 years ago: I've definitely noticed a trend of negative posts fluctuating on this subreddit, even more so than usual. Many complain about the stress, complain about grades, or complain about life in general around this period of time. For some: Finals have started. For others: They don't start for a while. Whatever the case may be, I just want to remind everyone that might come across this post: 



**You will be okay.**



I have had near mental breakdowns during certain semesters near finals week, have come close to breaking down in tears (I've seen lots of people actually reach this point in the library at my school), and I've had thoughts that are darker than I'd like to admit or be comfortable sharing with a public audience. 



As a final semester senior, I am still here, I am still fine, and literally EVERY fucking time I am done with finals week I get an enormous sense of relief and once I get my grades back I realize finals week wasn't that bad at all- that the stress and anxiety was amplified temporarily- and that's okay.

"29, first time in college. I'm nervous!","My family doesn't have much money, and I was afraid of the debt, so I did not choose college after HS. I bummed around for a while, struggling to find jobs during the recession, and then I decided to enlist. No regrets! Now I'm set up with the post-9/11 GI bill, and ready to pursue a Bachelor's in education. I'm registered for the fall semester and classes are only a few weeks away from starting. I'm first generation for my family, and ridiculously exited. But anxious. 

I honestly just don't really know what to expect. I graduated high school 11 years ago, but got crap grades because I often neglected homework. I never had to study for tests as a teen, I'd always been a good tester and cruised right through. My military job was very technical, and I had to learn to actually study in order to perform well. I've heard that college is more study-heavy than homework-heavy, I've heard from some that's it's harder than HS and from others that it's easier. I've been told that you're sort of teaching yourself. 

Can anyone maybe describe how an average lecture goes? Amounts of homework? What the heck is assigned reading about? I know they won't hold my hand, but can I approach a professor if I'm having trouble understanding something? Should I bring my laptop, or a tablet, and why? WHY ARE BOOKS SO EXPENSIVE?! And why the hell would anyone use Pearson stuff? It seems designed only to gouge everyone's wallets..",69,443,81.5705240690239,college
"No major feels safe; 26 years old and two years into community college, I still have zero idea what my next step is. (Advice very appreciated)","For context, I'm a woman in my mid-twenties renting a bedroom in an incredibly expensive part of the country, no relatives or friends to fall back on. I'm not here for the cute cafes, I'm here because I'm kinda stuck (no funds to get out) and also because there are a lot of great schools in this area. I go to the best community college I could find, and it has a decently high transfer rate. 

Right now I'm just working through my GE courses, but I'm coming to the point where I need to pick a major--pick a path and stick to it (at least I'd *prefer* to choose one I can stick to). I've considered graphic design, psychology, or just getting certified to be a medical transcriptionist or ultrasound tech, but nothing I feel remotely capable of feels safe. 

In order to make decent money with a psych degree, I'd need to get my masters or a doctorate, which I really can't afford to do at the moment. Even if I had the money, I don't have the *time*, as I work full-time working near minimum wage just to *live* in this ridiculous city. Graphic design, though interesting, isn't the most stable option. A few years ago I'd have been willing to weather the storm, but at this point I'm desperate for something more dependable than contract work. Preferably something salaried. 

(And yes, I know salaried design jobs exist, but just thinking about how competitive and unpredictable it can be makes my stomach turn.)

>**TLDR;**

The more time I spend working toward my BA the more terrified I become. None of us know what the job market is going to look like in forty years as automation creeps in and snatches up more opportunities, and my greatest fear is working my ass off to become financially secure only to get screwed over and reach retirement age without any savings. I already feel like enough of a failure as a 26 year old with no family and $200 in the bank, earning my degree surrounded by rich teenagers who can drop $10 on coffee every day. 

Before you tell me to learn how to code (trust me, I've considered it), I should mention that I'm not at all math minded. Not even a little. I failed fucking *pre-algebra* last quarter because the second we get into variables, everything becomes a jumbled mess; tbh I'm almost positive that I have dyscalculia but can't afford to get it diagnosed. I can't imagine doing too well in STEM, which is unfortunate because it would be a lot more reliable than most other options. 

**Right now I'm REALLY interested in instructional design**. I have a friend in the field making six figures, and it seems like genuinely enjoyable work. I've even built a presentation for a job interview with one of the most commonly used programs, so I'm familiar with the basic mechanics and concepts. 

**I'd love to hear from anyone who might have some insight on/advice for my situation; I've been stuck in the middle of it for so long that I can't tell up from down anymore, and I'm petrified at the thought of making the wrong choice and ending up with a useless degree or dead-end career.**

I’m already excited for school to start again,"You always want school to end up but now I want school to start up again. During the summer I move back home 4 hours away from school. I’m working a full time 50 hour job. Luckily it pays really nice, but it’s a lot of hours and a lot of hard work. It has nothing to do with my major since I couldn’t get an internship, and the work is pretty tough. 

On top of the job parents are unreasonably strict, come up with more rules every day, and favor my siblings. They treat me like a middle schooler and not someone half way done with college. 

And I can barely see my girlfriend because she lives back by my college. We’ll get to see each other every 2-3 weekends, but again my parents don’t give us any alone time so it’s just not the same. Luckily there’s FaceTime otherwise I would go crazy. 

Anyone else like college much more than summer? It sucks",43,445,139.80580184680167,college
I would like to warn you about the possibility of post-college depression. I wish somebody had done the same for me. [Semi long],"If you grew up anything like me, a large focus from age 5-18 was the prospect of going to college. Teachers at school would often talk about it. Parents would start to ask you around age 14 which college you'd like to attend. Your parents' friends ask you if you've made your decision and what your major will be. You make your decision. You leave your crying mother in the car as she drives away after dropping you off freshman year. You change your major. You change it again. You revert back to what it was originally. Graduation day comes, you did it! You passed with flying colors, barely scraped by, or did somewhere in the middle. Selfies with your friends group abound at graduation, all of you swearing you'll remain bestest friends for forever until the end of time, no matter what. Now, you're 5 months post-graduation working your 9-5 and it hits you. ""Man, this *sucks*"". What happened?

While it's impossible to nail down specific causes of this phenomenon for everybody, what I can nail down are some near-universal truths that I've came to realize in the 5 years since I have graduated. 

* Number 1: The lifestyle change can be very jarring. 

I can't remember where I saw it, but somebody said ""College is a weird time in your life because you're effectively an unemployed alcoholic but your parents are still proud of you"". I went from not worrying about having to pay for bills, being surrounded by friends, going to one three hour lecture every other day (rest of my classes were online), and partying every weekend to busting my ass at a ""grown up"" job in a new city with very few people that I knew. Post-college can be extra hard if you move to a new city where you don't know many people or if you go to a familiar city but your friends have all moved away. College is something that is so built up for so many people that once it has came and went, the smile quickly fades as you ask yourself ""So I have worked my whole life up to this point for this moment and now that it's over, what do I do?""

* Number 2: Maintaining friendships after college is much more difficult 

When you're in college, all you have time to do is study and hang out with your friends. You have thousands of people around your age that you have something in common with. A surefire way to introduce yourself is to ask somebody what their name and major are. Easy, right? You don't necessarily have this luxury post-college. 

When you graduate from college and move away from your friends, life tends to get in the way. People get boyfriends and girlfriends. People have babies. People get busy with their careers. People find other groups of friends in their town to hang out with. In college, you may have hardly had a choice *but* to make friends. However, afterwards, maintaining friendships can take *a lot* of work. If you're not careful, you can slowly fade away from people who you thought were going to be your life long friends and that can leave you feeling destitute. 

* Number 3: You change A LOT in your 20's (most of the time)

Most people will go to college starting around 18 and graduate when they are 22-25. Zach Braff, who played John Dorian on the TV show ""Scrubs"" has a very profound quote that I agree with whole heartedly. He said ""‎""I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties."" In my experience, that is SO true. You'll be constantly changing and evolving as you progress through your twenties, your mind catching up with your body. They say that your brain isn't fully developed until you're in your mid-twenties, and I for one can attest to that. As a 26 year old, I am NOT the same person that I was when I graduated a few years ago. I have evolved mentally, physically, and emotionally into a man that any parent would be proud of. However, that comes with a lot of perspective changing and lifestyle-alterations. 

* Number 4: You might realize that the field you selected to study is not the one for you. 

I spent years trying to make law-enforcement type jobs work for me, as a Criminal Justice major (hint; DO NOT STUDY CRIMINAL JUSTICE. Minor in it if you must, but major in something that will give you hard skills such as computer science or accounting). Corrections Officer. Private Investigator. Loss Prevention Detective. I jumped from one position to the next before I came to the conclusion that this field was NOT for me. This depressed the shit out of me because I felt like I was stuck. I did not have any hard skills to show and I was desperate to get out of the field. I remember flying home to visit my parents about 2 years after I graduated. We went out to a Mexican restaurant and I cried at the table because I was so hopelessly destitute about my job situation at that time. Now, through careful maneuvering and by going back to school, I have successfully transitioned into IT and I love it. If you do not like where you are career-wise, change it. It sucks having to start all over again from the bottom, but I am a hell of a lot happier than I was making 3x what I'm making now. 

As I said in the title, this is a story of the *possibility* of post-college depression. I do realize that many people will not experience this, but many people who I have spoken to about the matter have, including myself. 

The very very TL;DR of this post is that life after college is depressing and takes some adjusting to, friendships are something that you have to work at to maintain, and if you find out your major isn't for you, take steps to get out of that field.

I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn’t hate my life. Here’s how.," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends & family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult.

Professor is accusing me of cheating off another student I've never spoken to. Wtf do I do? Online class.,"

EDIT: 
The other student took my discussion board post and used it for their essay. I used my own post for the essay, just added fluff to it. This is why it got flagged as word for word. Hopefully he changes my grade, since I can't control what another student takes from discussion boards that are visible for all. 




----OP-----


I checked my grade on an essay yesterday, it was a 0 and had a comment from the professor ""did you cheat off of x or did x cheat off of you?"" I didn't recognize the name, so I replied asking what they meant, I only used one source for my work and it was the text book given, and I quoted every source. 

Then I looked through the students names and realized x is another student in the online class with me, I've never even replied to one of their comments on a discussion board. 

I emailed the professor again explaining that I don't know the student, and would like to see their work to compare. 

Professor replied with my essay and highlighted a part that was ""almost word for word"" from the other students. And said ""this is not a coincidence""

This guy obviously is not going to believe me, but I know the truth. The other student knows the truth. What can I do to get this figured out? I can't fail this class. I don't want to be accused of something I did not do, especially when it's plagiarism.

Nursing actually excites me and I just feel like it's what I should have done a long time ago.

I’m assuming that it won’t be a problem since there isn’t any gender restrictive rules set in either of our dorms. Like I asked, I just want to know if it’s really worth it or is it a waste of time and energy?

Thank everyone!",61,436,65.7849453653202,college

Is it possible to just be BAD at math?,"People say *""you can't be bad at math, you're just lazy""* or *""you're not studying correctly.""*

Meanwhile I've worked my ass off to get two C's and one B in my 3 pre-calculus classes (business major here on quarter system at my community college, have to take calculus next). I understand the material, and I'm not the WORST test taker, I go to office hours, but math just doesn't come naturally to me. I hate being called ""lazy"" for not acing math. I work hard, I have all A's and B's except for my math classes.

Here's my question:

I took piano lessons for YEARS as a kid (parents forced me to) and I was never a natural at it. I sucked at reading music notes (especially quickly), I struggled with understanding the measure and beats and all that (never understood the difference between 6/8, 3/4, etc.), it took me weeks to play a song with only a few mistakes. *I had NO rhythm.* I was never told that I was ""lazy"" or ""practicing wrong"", people just told me that music wasn't for me.

Why isn't it the same way with math?

edit: Got it. Got your DMs calling me lazy, stupid, etc. I get it, I'm an idiot.

I'm so frustrated. My brother, a software engineer, has said ""I suck at writing/English"" forever, nobody batted an eye. My parents love him, yet hate me.

People say they suck at history, writing, philosophy, drawing, acting, dancing, music... nobody cares. With math? Suddenly, I'm not working hard enough?

Thanks for making me feel shittier than I already felt. Can always count on you, Reddit. :(

I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",149,426,87.51220230976465,college

Before every semester, I get this intense feeling of doom. It starts off as anxiety (I’m already medicated for it) whenever I think about college because it stems into a million different thoughts. It gets really bad all day until it breaks and I get a sense of relief

The 2020-2021 FAFSA will open October 1, 2019.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

FAFSA questions posted on /r/college must be in this thread. Standalone posts will be removed.

I came into class, after studying for my last final of the semester and came into class early to chat among people - to get some hints and tips. But 5 minutes before class, no one showed up. A thought came to my head, I quickly checked the syllabus, and before I knew it - the final was not yesterday, but TWO days ago.  

Every single professor I've had has split their week in half (going for the latter day) to have their final, so I automatically assumed that my final would be Thursday. So I basically just shit my pants when I found out that was not the case with this class. 

I panicked and walked out of the classroom, emailing my professor - ""Hey, I missed my final. If I can retake it, that would be awesome but if not I respect your decision and will accept my grade""

After shitting myself for a couple minutes, he emails back almost immediately - saying that we'll ""talk"" in 10 minutes, since he was heading there. (Which I did not know, thought class was cancelled).

And, after some consideration, he says that he knows I have perfect attendance for the class and have great grades in it - and he will let me take the final...NO PENALTY. 

I probably didn't do too hot on the final, but it's a lot better than a fucking zero. 

So the lesson learned here is the generic: do well in class because it will payoff when you act like a dumbass.",21,389,165.01456342087576,college

I failed. 1.92 GPA. I don’t know where to go from here.,"*Edit 2: this post is getting a lot of attention, I just want to thank everyone for their advice. I definitely see my flaws. I have a game plan now on how to approach this next semester. It’s a hill to climb, and I will do it. Thank you!*

In Highschool I was the kid who could get off without studying. 3.8 GPA for the kid who took AP classes, partied, listened to punk rock and showed up late to class.

First semester of college. I get A- in Chem, C in Physics and flat out fail Calculus. Just because of that one stupid fucking class my GPA is below the minimum and now I’m stuck. I got issued an academic warning. My first semester was hard. I was forced to commute to college, I got fired from my job and found a new one. My relationship ended. I had to deal with my group of friends being disbanded. And I lost my burning motivation for a split second to keep working out. I didn’t party or drink at all. I showed up to class and did the homework. Guess it wasn’t enough.

Now I’m waiting on an email from my advisor on what to do and what the consequences are.

My game plan for the next semester given they let me continue to take the next sequence of classes, is to cut down the amount of Xbox I play, go to office hours and actually do the problems on the homework. I tried. I really did. I don’t understand I see all these memes and tweets of people praying they pass and they do, but here I am, actually giving it my best, and I fail. I’m hurt and scared. I don’t know what to do. I’m a chem Major and I intend to stick with it.

Making some radical life changes mid-semester because I noticed I'm failing,"Just failed to turn in a 100pt assignment, bringing my grade down from a 93 to an 83 (temporary obviously still might kill my A). It was really eye opening because I thought I spent hours on this assignment (cancelled plans, multiple work sessions etc.) but I use a program that tracks the time I spend coding and I only spent 2 hours in the last two weeks on this assignment.  2 hours out of probably 10 that I was sitting ""working"". If I had been working that whole time it would definitely be done. I'm hanging in there in my other classes with As but just barely.



If you're in this position, I encourage you to join me in grounding yourself (kind of like your parents did, but think of it as healthy self care instead):


- sleep 11pm-7am 


- no reddit.already have it blocked on my computer, after tomorrow Im blocking it on my phone. Same goes for buzzfeed, quora, netflix etc.


- at least 1-2 hrs coding a day and 3 hours homework 


- i have to go to every professor's office hours this week


- no clubs, time with friends, parties etc. until I'm caught up with school and my job, or until thanksgiving comes (time with partner is ok)


- no more missed or half assed assignments


- no phone during the day. Im going to leave it in my dorm.




General lifestyle things (I'm curious how these will go since some of them are coping mechanisms and I'm super stressed):


- no sugar. Im getting fat and its all because of the sweets. With savory food I stop when full but with sweets I'm an addict.


- 10 mins stretching a day (or more, as a break from studying)


- at least 1 salad a day

- vit d in morning. Melatonin at night


- no drinks but water and tea


- no listening to music during the day( I end up just dancing instead of doing homework)



-no sitting in bed unless its almost bedtime (I spend like 1/2 my life in bed, its terrible. Nothing ever gets done in bed)


- no picking at skin/keep up skin care routine. Tooth whitening. I want to look less like the chubby, neglected asshole I am for my family. I'm going to tackle nail biting over christmas.

Any free time will be spent exercising, basking in the sun, with close friends, doing art, reading, or working through a mindfulness workbook I got. Here's to buckling down and making your parents proud!

I go to a 89.3, out of range of even an A-. I was in awe, there was no way i could have got that score! I knew everything!

"For those suffering from anxiety/mental health disorders, visit your disability center for assistance.","I never realized that as a student I qualified for the disability center at my school, because of my severe anxiety and depression issues. 

Upon acceptance, your disability center can help you make arrangements with your professors for extra time to do exams, excuse absences and assignments, and even replace a class that may cause extreme anxiety for you. 

Sadly, I didn’t find this out until I was well beyond my college career, and after many failed/low scoring classes.

So if you’re someone who’s struggling with mental health issues, consider taking a visit to your disability center to see if you can qualify to receive help for your classes.

Btw, registering with the disability center at your school is confidential and does not go on your transcript, nor goes on your record. ",48,380,295.9717740690239,college
I hate college & have 100k in debt,"Hi,

I’m a 20 year old Junior at a tech institute studying Management Information Systems. I’m realizing that college is not for me, as I have Borderline Personality Disorder and also a big hatred for my school. My school is responsible for me not receiving a very important internship, and billed me $2700 for trying to move out of campus housing that was growing black mold and has asbestos (no idea what my legal options are there).

I’m currently 100k in debt ( middle class family, bad luck with financial aid), and I want out of my tech school. I’m good at my focus in my major, Database Management Systems, but I don’t know if that’s the path I want to take. I’d be willing to, but I absolutely hate being at my current school and in classroom settings in total. I’ve been able to get 3.0 gpa every semester putting in no effort at all, and I just can’t see myself ever being motivated to keep going to this school and now my grades are beginning to suffer.

I’ve thought about transferring, but my long term girlfriend goes to the same school and we live together, and I’m not really willing to leave her because i’m basically the only person in her life so moving would devestate her. There’s a community college nearby that I haven’t really looked into yet, but I’m not sure what degrees I could get there that could pay off my debt.

I’m basically asking if there’s a way out or if I’m stuck. I’ve never explored options other than university because my parents and teachers pushed me into it and convinced me it was the only way I’d have a happy/successful life (I used to be very trusting/oblivious/naive). I’d be willing to go to a community college, but like I said I don’t know if there’s any jobs that pay high enough to live with my debt. This situation is making my BPD very bad and it’s taking a toll on my mental state. The mental health services at my school are awful (1 appt a month at best) and my insurance puts up a fight for paying for therapists, so it feels like I’m hopeless there as well.

Any input would be appreciated. For reference, most of my debt is from private loans and i’m a first generation student.",180,380,240.0889152727276,college

"Dropped out twice, kept hiding it, now I'm on my last rope.","Hello guys,

the first semester I went to university I did pretty well, aced my exams, but for the life of me couldn't manage to write essays. My work ethic is shit and I procrastinated to the point of no return. Didn't habe any friends due to social shame, isolated myself from the world. My parents are the extremely strict academic type-parents so I didn't dare tell them anything about how I was struggling with uni. Meanwhile I had developed severe depression and went undiagnosed for 2-3 semesters, tried to take my life once but through some miracle I survived.

After 4 semesters of hiding, I finally confessed to my parents and they made me feel like I was the dirtiest piece of trash alive. I was extremely scared, ashamed, I just broke down mentally but had no other choice than to switch to anither university. 

Here, I had the same problems, still going with my depression and flunked out in my 2nd semester, because I felt so hollow that I couldn't get to studying and just indulged in video games. I kept this fact hidden and now I'm nearing my 4th semester, when I'm actually unable to keep studying my major. I can't switch it anymore either. I have no one to help me and my parents, who take full financial responsibility over my studies, are probably going to have a heart attack (I'm not joking) and feel like I'm out to make their life miserable, which I definitely am. I'm lost and scared.

I tried applying to another university now, but I spent the last 4 years of my life achieving nothing. My lifeline is going, I'm so filled with dread, guilt, shame, anger, frustration, self-hatred day in day out... I don't know where to go. Can anyone help? What should I do?

How do I deal with my envy of the “party life?”,"So I’m a freshman and my year’s going pretty well so far, but I’m kind of wondering if I’m following the right path.

I look around at the fraternities and sororities and I see others partying every weekend. There’s also the big football game day where everyone is a fan. I’m torn: on one hand, I know that I dislike just about everything about these things. On the other hand, it seems like everyone else is having more fun than me.

As a bit of background, I’m a kind of introverted person, and have usually made only a few close friends. In high school and now, I hold myself to a pretty strict focus on schoolwork and prefer organized activities to just like “hanging out.” I have never drank or done drugs, and have no desire to do so. I’m not really a spectator sports fan and I also (maybe critically) don’t use Snapchat. Like messaging is fine, but I think snap streaks are stupid, although everyone else seems to network with it.

So basically, I have good reasons to not get involved with partying or anything like that, but I can’t help but feel a little jealous of everyone else who seems to be having more fun. I talk to other kids who seem pretty chill, and hearing them talk about partying and drinking is intriguing to me because it’s such a foreign concept that I’ve never even considered. I still have no desire to drink, Snapchat, “get wasted,” or whatever, but most of the kids my age seem to connect with each other at parties and stuff where that happens.

Bluntly, I’m interested in social action besides the nerds: I’m throughly a nerd and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I’d like to connect with other people too and try different things without getting involved with stupid or illegal activities. I know FOMO but like I do feel like that sometimes. Can anyone else give me any advice? Suggestions? Relatable issue? ",107,371,331.4934870319869,college

Dropping out of Top 20 College,"Last year, I was a senior and I committed to a top 20 school. I was near the top of my class and many teachers praised me and said I would do amazing things in the future. At this university, I was chosen to do a selective program the summer before my freshman year. I quickly realized that I really did not like the school; I was miserable there and incredibly homesick. I made lots of friends and learned a lot through this program, but I found myself dreading the upcoming school year. Right before I was supposed to move-in, I talked with my parents and told them I wanted to go somewhere else for school. They were understanding and helped me get enrolled at my local community college. Right now, my grades are stellar and I take primarily honors courses. However, I can't help but feel like a failure. All my friends, family, and teachers were expecting me to go to this prestigious school and accomplish so many things yet I find myself wallowing around at home. I haven't made any friends at school or joined any clubs. Along with this, all my closest friends from high school currently attend top 20 schools and I just feel so incompetent in comparison. I am no longer interested in going to some elite school after my experience with this program, so I am planning on just transferring to my state school. Could anyone give me any advice?

College wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. 4 years of my life will be gone.  I don't even know how to determine if I had grown as a person in the past 2-and-a-half years.

How well does your university respond to ice/snow hazards on campus? (UW student death),"For those who may not have the sad news, a fellow student passed away yesterday as a result of slipping and falling on the way to class. 

Story here: https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/uw-student-dies-after-slipping-and-falling-on-campus/915789730

I’m curious of the efforts that other school place on clearing all ice on major walkways throughout campus. This story is extremely saddening to think about, and it could have happened to anyone. The fact that school resumed to normal operations after two snow days but there was still a lot of thick ice on paths comes across as negligent and I’m curious if this is common at other schools.

PSA: The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opens October 1! Post all FAFSA questions here!,"The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opened on October 1, 2017. If you plan to attend college during the 2018-2019 school year, you should submit a FAFSA if you are [eligible](https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm) to do so.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If mom/dad has already created an FSA ID (for older siblings), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, 2016 tax information, any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.gov/)!
If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Post your questions about the FAFSA only on this thread, so as to avoid clogging the sub with posts. I work in financial aid and I will be happy to help.

**Please reference [last year's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/54mjwp/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20172018_school_year_opens/) before posting-- your question may have been addressed there.**",638,365,773.2193898097646,college

The Issue with Extra Curricular Leadership Positions,"I go to a very competitive school and one major concern on everyone’s mind is the need to get an extracurricular leadership position. Observing my peers, I noticed something that resulted from this environment: leadership cannibalization.

What exactly is this? Assume you’re a club leader interviewing people for a position. You receive a bunch of resumes and notice a candidate who is already involved in multiple clubs with leadership experience. You’re impressed and are highly considering offering the position to this student.

You go on and conduct interviews. With no surprise, this candidate of interest performs exceptionally well. It’s a tough call between her and a few other students, so you pick her based on how impressive her resume is. Given her involvement, she surely will be successful taking on the position, right? Wrong!

You offer the candidate the role and she accepts. As time goes on, you notice her performance is lacking. This student is always busy; sometimes she can’t always attend meetings due to other events or whatever the case may be. Although this student is bright, she can’t fully dive into the position and contribute as much as anticipated due to her other extracurriculars digging into her schedule. This is leadership cannibalization.

The issue at hand is that (at least at my school) there is a huge gap between students who are highly and little involved with leadership opportunities. The ones who are highly involved take control of many available opportunities which results in the gap and degraded performance. Students aren’t concerned with what they can achieve with one position but how many positions they can put on a piece of paper. This mentality is wrong!

In the end, I wanted to share this idea and see if anyone here agrees. I think people involved on campus should be highly conscious of this and focus more on developing meaningful experiences rather than racking up positions like its a trophy collection. There is only so much you can do with only 24 hours a day.

tldr: There is a gap between students highly and little involved with campus leadership opportunities. Students with leadership roles are far more likely to acquire more. This drives the gap and also results in poor performance since such students have to handle very demanding schedules.",31,358,302.56163518013506,college
Dealing with arrogant people in a class,"Day 1 of Calculus 1 class. A few of us students are gathered around, talking about their previous experience in calculus. This kid walks into the room, and announces ""I got a 5 on the AP calculus BC exam. *I'm* only here for an easy A"". then proceeds to brag about how he got an A in honors physics in high school. 

Oh boy.

I sit next to this kid, because we both sit in the front row. He is *so* annoying. Every class, he's either:

\-  bragging about how easy he finds calculus (Prof: ""Ok this can be a tricky concept....."" Kid: ""I get it!! I think it's easy!!"")

\-making comments about how much he knows, etc. ("" I did something like this in honors physics!!"")

\- asking tangentially related questions to the syllabus

\- sucking up to the professor. Like, he told the professor, ""I'm going to change my major and become a math professor because you've inspired me so much"" then asked if he could help the professor grade papers.

\- brags about how little sleep he gets and how hard his workload is. He says he's taking 7 classes this semester, which I *know* is complete bullshit because the engineering department wouldn't let you take 7 classes.

Advice on how to wake up a super heavy sleeper?,"So I am an RA this year and have been trying to solve an issue with a resident who cannot wake up to his alarm. His alarm is insanely loud, it can be heard through the whole (small) dorm and outside. It wakes everyone else up but not him. He has even had this thing go off for 3 straight hours before. I have banged and knocked on the door to wake him with no luck, and having only pissed everyone off more due to the additional noise. The only thing that has worked is me keying into the room to wake him up myself, but I am not being his personal alarm clock, that isn't my job.

Does anyone have any waking up systems that aren't just louder/more noises? The noises don't awake him, but they bother every other person in the dorm.

How can I socialize without drinking?,"I've been in college for a year now, and somehow, every social activity seems to involve drinking. Even during chill hangout sessions with my friends, watching some dumb movie, someone ends up pulling out the liquor. It's not that I judge people who drink (lord knows I used to have my fun), but early freshman year I started medication that makes it so I can't have alcohol. I don't smoke, either.

I get that for a lot of people college is the first time they get to let loose, and I don't want to prevent my friends from being able to do that. It's just that I'm getting tired of being the only sober one in the room. The more I'm around alcohol, the more I think I should just have one drink, to be a part of it all, but I know that's the wrong choice. I thought we were having plenty of fun when our hangouts didn't involve drinking, but now I'm worried that if I ask for us to have a few more sober occasions, I'll be a total buzzkill. 

I worry it's ruining my chances with new friends, too. I've just joined a program at school, and I really want to get to know everyone, but all of the group hangout sessions have been about partying and going to local bars. I couldn't even go if I wanted to, since I don't have a fake.

People with social anxiety: how do you deal with presentations?,"So far ive done a few presentations in my college life.


 1. was for my Spanish class. For both Spanish 1 and 2. The teacher allowed us to Literally just read from the slides since she knew that most people weren't good at talking Spanish. So thats how I managed to do it even though I'm fluent in Spanish.

2. For a computee science class. Long story short, it was a train wreak. i stuttered and it was awful and cringy. I blame myself for not being prepared. 

3. Supposubly it was for a physics class but I chose not to do it and got a 0. Although i still passed with a low 70 though since it was like 20% so its all good.

4. Speech class. I enrolled I this class twice and twice I dropped it because I just can't deal with the pressure of speaking in class. I managed to 'survive' the first couple of weeks in this class but stopped attending since just sitting in the lecture room, id start to feel incredibly nervous, shaky and uneasy.

5. I'm currently  taking a class that requires me to do a presentation at the end of the semester. Obviously I'm not sure if ill be able to pass this one since its worth 30% of my overall grade. 

Overrall, ive always been quiet and shy. I dont have friends at college. At first I hated that but I learned to be ok with it and it doesn't bother me no more. The only friends I have are my old high school friends but I rarely see them since they don't go to college.I tried following the classic 'join a club' advice and I did do it. It always emds up the same. Everyone is has their groups of friends. Even if I do try to interact with them, they usually briefly reply but them focus on what their group is doing. I did briefly volunteer but the same thing would happen.

My grades are bad because I would rather just use Google to get answers to questions rather than go to office hours. I have no internships but tried to go to career fairs. Most of the time it ends up the same. I come of as awkward and weird. 

Part of me feels like ill never get my degree because I just can't deal with speaking in class or people in general and I've considered dropping completely. I realize that as I advance further in my degree (Computer science), I'm required to do more presentations.

I ended off my first semester with a 3.1, I'm doing better in my classes this semester but I still feel like my gpa with never be good enough to both gain acceptance to medical school and get the air force rotc scholarship for it. Not matter how much I study I still feel like it will never get better.

Any advice on how to get over this feeling?",51,335,206.57354490235724,college
The school I was set to transfer to this fall canceled my offer of admission,"As mentioned in the title, I was finally going to transfer to a four year this fall after spending 3 years at a CC in California. If you guys aren't familiar with how CC to four year transfer works, you need to have completed a minimum of 60 IGETC units to be able to transfer.

Spring 2019 was supposed to be my last semester, however something really bad happened to me during the last two weeks of classes. I was sent to the ER with really bad pains in my feet and hands, turns out I was diagnosed with a highly contagious disease and prevented me from going anywhere. Because of this I reached out to all my professors right away to make arrangements on what I could do in regards to me being unable to set foot on campus to take my finals. Luckily I was was able to work something out with 2 out of 3 of my professors and passed both of those. However, my bio professor never got back to me, even after countless emails and phone calls to his office. Long story short: he gave me an F and I was scared shitless so I reached out to my new college ASAP.

&#x200B;

I informed them about the whole situation and asked what I needed to do so that my admission offer would stay in tact. The told me to contact them right away with unofficial transcripts and a letter of explanation. I explained the whole situation with the medical problem and unresponsive professor. Even after all that they said because of the missing credits from the bio class, they have to cancel my offer of admission. Ever since then I've honestly been really down and can feel my depression coming back despite my efforts of staying positive.

&#x200B;

So I reached out to the dean of natural sciences at my CC and basically snitched on my professor for not responding to students and for giving me an inaccurate grade because of my medical situation. An administrative assistant got back to me and informed me that because of the 4th of July they won't get back to me until Monday but she told me that she informed the dean right away to get a hold of this professor to see if they could change the status of the class to incomplete or get a grade change for me.

&#x200B;

Now my question is, has this happened to anyone before? If so what happened in your situation? If I got a grade change and contacted the university, could they reinstate my offer of admission? Because I honestly don't want to wait another year and reapply to universities all over again. As a first-gen, my family is all really psyched for me to be finally going to a university and so am I. But if I don't end up going to university this fall, I'll have to wait a whole year and I really don't want to waste anymore time. Please offer my any advice, because I'm deadass terrified.

&#x200B;

Edit: Professor never responded, dean & department sided with him. I am now waiting a whole year to be able to transfer, thanks to this stupid professor. I am also forced to retake Bio in the fall because no grade change. Thanks for everyone who responded though, I tried everything you guys told me to!",21,339,101.22318610606094,college
I can’t tell if I chose the wrong school,I just finished my first freshman semester at college . I chose a school very close to home but I’m living in the dorm. I’m a music performance major. All through the college process I KNEW I wasn’t going to attend this university but 2 weeks before decision day they offered me a spot in a prestigious music program at their school along with a decent scholarship so I eventually caved and went to this school. I guess the people in the music school are OK (I’m not SUPER SUPER close with anyone but I have a couple of decent friends) but I feel like I don’t fit in with the university as a whole. I’m the quiet nerdy type and the majority of this school just wants to hookup and party All the time. I don’t fit in at all. Most people I know are saying things like “wow I CANT WAIT to get back to school and see all my friends” and “I love break but am SO EXCITED to go back go university”..and I’m over here just dreading going back. I had issues with depression and anxiety (and BAD procrastination) last semester so I can’t tell if I’m unhappy about going back do to my own issues or if I truly truly don’t belong at this school. I feel trapped and lost right now .. I’m telling myself that if I’m still unhappy these first few weeks I’m going to start applications in February to transfer for sophomore year.

"I got academically dismissed and now I don’t know what path to take,","so you know how you can either be either a master at one thing OR good enough at a lot of things?

i’m [22F] the second one. i used to love that about myself because i could try so many things but now its kind of fucking me over. 

my parents were always very strict and on top of me about my grades. they paid for me to go to college a couple years, and i didn’t do so well. 

i was academically dismissed and basically wasted 2 years of college. my parents are still so disappointed in me. 

a big reason i failed was because i kept changing majors and didn’t know what the hell i wanted to do. i still don’t know what i want to do.

i have spent all the time since then taking courses at a community college and bartending. 

i know the importance of getting a degree but i just feel like i’m not getting the hang of college and i never will. but i don’t want to disappoint my parents or myself. 

also, if i get back into the university i would have to pay loans and i don’t know if its even worth it anymore. 

here are the 4 career paths that i would be okay with. 

1. interior designer: i absolutely love and enjoy interior design, but its a very risky path to take. 
2. stand up comedian: my dream job since day 1, but not very realistic.
3. social psychologist: i am super interested in how/why people interact with each other. but i feel like i would never get a job. 
4. computer scientist: my parents dream job for me, which is understandable because of the salary. i am really good in all math courses but i don’t think i would enjoy coding for the rest of my life. 

what would you do if you were me? should i listen to my parents or should i follow a passion instead, even if its a risk?",65,333,169.66019999494983,college

Do you read the syllabus,"Hi all, prof here. I'm putting my syllabi together for Fall semester and would like to include statements in there about various campus resources (food pantry, violence prevention center, mental health services, etc). This would be beyond what is usually required by my university, however I would like to make as much info available as I can, particularly for first year students. 

But, my question: do students actually read the syllabus? I know from years of teaching that students often don't even read the grade requirements and more essential class policies. So, how helpful is it to include additional information about other campus resources? What do you think?

How to Confront A Bad Roommate,"I really need some help. I have an awful roommate and I’m in tears writing this. I am very socially anxious and my roommate (shared bedroom) needs to have a lot more respect for me. I have no idea how to talk to her and I can’t go to an RA because I feel like she is gonna tell me to talk to her before I even mention anything to the RA. She never goes to class and doesn’t have a car or job so she is in the room 24/7 almost. She is not paying the school any money because FAFSA denied her since she failed last semester and is failing this one. It makes me so upset she is here. I am a nursing student and I work up to 35 hours a week as a nurse’s assistant. I have lots of late nights and early mornings and sometimes I do not sleep for over 24 hours because I work two part time jobs. My sleep is so important to me. She is constantly going in and out of the room from 10pm - 4 am. She has had multiple boys over in the room without warning me and I feel very uncomfortable because they come in at 2 am when I’m asleep and I get woken up by them. I often sleep in a nightshirt and I can’t even get up to go to the bathroom because I don’t want the guy to see my in my nightshirt, maybe I am just bashful I don’t know. She sleeps with the TV very loud on after I asked her to turn it down and I physically went over and turned it down because she’s not even watching it I thought she was asleep. She often leaves the door unlocked and does not take her keys and asks me to leave it unlocked. A few nights ago, in the middle of the night, a girl came into the room without knocking because my roommate had asked me to leave it unlocked and she was gone for over two hours. Her friend rummaged around looking for food. I cannot sleep here. I’m sorry if this post is a mess but I don’t know what to do. I feel as if she is not going to change and it’s not fair I’m paying to live here and I feel awkward and honestly a bit unsafe. I feel trapped and I want to start sleeping in my car.

my parents don’t support my major,"it’s not official yet but i want to change my major to psychology. as of right now i’m a biology major and i hate it- it’s nothing but science courses and biological electives. it’s also more geared for pre-med students, which isn’t me. 

i’m passionate about psychology, i’m better at it, i enjoy the writing as i read a lot and pride myself in having good writing skills. im pre-physicians assistant regardless of what my major is, so isn’t that all the more reason to major in something i actually enjoy? also, if for some reason i change my mind about the PA track (which i’m considering), i would be interested in getting my masters in something psych related. my parents hate this idea because it means more schooling and more money to spend but i’m going to be stuck with student loan debt regardless, so why not go ahead and get my masters? 

also, my parents don’t understand no matter how many times i tell them that i can major in anything i want and still be pre-PA. i’ve had to explain this so many times to them and it’s like they get amnesia or something, and i have to tell them again. a few months ago when i decided i wanted to change my major and explained to them that i would still aim for PA school, they were supportive. 

and finally, i think my parents want me to major in something like biology because they care about how i look to other people. this is actually the reason i’m writing this post- we were talking to a neighbor and i told them my situation, and once i went back inside my mom blew up in my face telling me i’m wasting my time majoring in psych and that i’ll be working a dead-end job i don’t like. i had to explain to her that i’m still PA and like i said before, she doesn’t understand what the fuck i mean when i tell her i can major in just about anything and still go to PA school. also my neighbor was asking me questions about school and my dad started answering questions for me. it makes me so mad because i can tell they have some plan for me that they don’t want. i’ve ranted to my advisor about this more than once and she tells me every time to do what i want. what do i do in this situation? also how do i deal with my parents?

edit: 1) i am aware that what i said about debt is stupid and that i do not want more debt than less debt. 2) i am aware that a psychology BA is one of the most useless degrees i can get, which is why if i go through with psych i would go to grad school.",121,318,102.12813980976463,college

I failed in my due diligence to research other fields and allowed myself to be recruited into the recreation program. It was fun, but it did nothing for my career. Now at 60 I realize that I could have been successful teaching if I had only changed what I would have taught. The moral of the story is to choose your major wisely.

What to bring with you to your dorm,"There was a request in the megathread to make a new megathread dedicated to stuff to bring with you to college in hopes to cut down on the amount of people asking this question. We hope this will helpful for incoming freshman. If I miss anything on the list please comment down below so I can edit it in. If its received well I'll also consider putting it in the sidebar as a resource for future freshman that come to the subreddit in upcoming years. 




Remember that your dorm room will probably be smaller than your room at home. Don't bring too much stuff- especially too many clothes. 





**Essential Items To Bring**


* Personal Items- Student ID, Government Issued ID, some spending money or a debit/credit card, anything else you might need in order to secure employment on/off campus. 


* Bed Sheets

* Pillows + Pillow Cases


* Comforter + Blankets


* Laundry Basket


* Laundry Items (Detergent, Fabric Softener, Tide Pods, Whatever you use at home)


* Clothes Hangers

* Deodorant/antiperspirant  


* Any Medication you take at home


* Cold Medicine + Cough Drops. Sickness spreads fast in dorms. 



* Tissues 

* Napkins


* Umbrella + Clothing appropriate for rain/light snow


* Shower caddy


* Flip flops for the shower


* Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash/Anything else you use in the shower


* At least 2 towels 


* Toothbrush + Toothpaste. I've actually seen people forget this. 


* Anything else you usually use in the bathroom at home- floss, facial moisturizer, cotton swabs, hair dryer, etc 


* Shaving products


* Enough clothes. Don't bring your whole wardrobe but also don't bring so little that you have to do laundry every few days. I pack about 15 shirts, a couple pairs of pants, 15ish pairs of underwear and socks, and a few sweaters. 


* Formal Clothing. If you have a full suit consider bringing it. I bring a few dress shirts for interviews. You want to make sure you bring something other than just tshirts and jeans in case something comes up where you need to dress more formally. 


* A general first aid kit. At least have a few bandaids and antibiotic cream in case of minor injury


* Trash Bags. Trash bins are usually provided and you don't have to bring your own. 

* Water Bottle 


* Cleaning supplies to keep your room somewhat clean 



* Plastic forks/spoons/knives as well as bowls, plates, and cups. 


* Batteries if you use anything that requires batteries. 


* Extension cord. 

* Food. Stuff like Ramen you can keep in your room for a while without it going bad 


* Storage Bins or Boxes

**School Supplies** 



* Pens and Pencils + Eraser. 


* Pencil Sharpener if bringing non-mechanical pencils 


* Notebooks/Binders/Paper 



* Folders



* Backpack 


* Laptop or some form of computer. 


* Graphing Calculator 


* Stuff for taking Notes. Highlighters/Index Cards/Post-it Notes. Only bring if you think you'll use it. 



**Non-Essential Items that are useful or may come in handy**



* A fan 


* Headphones to block out noise


* Stamps/Envelopes in case you have to mail something


* A microwave and fridge (Check regulations for your school)


* TV/Monitor + Possible Gaming Consoles 


* Coffee Maker


* Electric Kettle

* Posters/Wall Decorations 


* Rug

* A toolkit 


* Flashlight 


* Iron 


* Kitchen products like pots/pans if you think you might cook once in a while instead of eat in the dining halls. 


* A shoe rack 


* A safe/footlocker if you wish to lock up valuables. 


* Door Decorations- some people really like the mini-whiteboard 


* Lint Brush 


* Condoms. RA's usually hand out free ones but I prefer bringing my own. 



* Tape



* Scissors 


* Paper Clips/Stapler 


* Lamps


* Bike/Skateboard. Be sure to bring a bike lock if you bring your bike. 


* Melatonin 

* Mattress Pad


* A picture frame with something to remind you of home


**What Not to Bring With You**



* Printer. Printers are available in the library and some universities, like mine, give a certain amount of free prints. I never use them up in a semester. Also people will hate you if you have a wifi printer. 



* Winter Clothing. Bring a hoodie or light jacket with you on move in day- but don't bring the heavy winter gear right away. Pick it up over thanksgiving break or visit home and bring it back with you. Only exception being if you're an international student or out of state student and won't be returning home until winter break. 



* Textbooks. If you are bringing textbooks with you on move-in day then you are making a classic freshman mistake. Textbooks are never required on the first day of class. Attend class first to see if its really going to be needed. And never buy full price. Free pdfs of textbooks are out there on the internet. If you're looking for a legal alternative- renting from sites like amazon is almost always way cheaper than buying a brand new textbook. 



* A chair. Unless you're 100% sure housing doesn't provide any- your chair will probably be sitting under your bed for the entire semester. 


* Stuff your roommate will be bringing. Reach out to your roommate and coordinate who brings what. You don't want to waste space by having two people bring the same item that you guys can just share. 

* Stuff your college provides. Some colleges provide, for instance, fridges and microwaves to their students living in dorms. If this is the case- don't bring your own. Check to see what is already provided to you. 

* Your highschool relationship. Especially if its gonna be long distance once you move into college. Consider if its really worth it. It usually doesn't work out and those long skype calls can prevent you from meeting other people in the beginning weeks of dorm life. Trust me- my relationship from highschool ended rather quickly once college started. 


* Banned Items. Check with housing to see what's allowed and what's not. I love the smell of candles but unfortunately they're just not allowed in my dorm or many dorms across the country. You don't want to bring something that could get you in trouble. 








Leave any suggestions and feedback down below. If you have any questions pertaining items not on the list feel free to ask below and someone will get back to you. There are lots of items that are acceptable to bring to college but I couldn't put every possible item on the list. Use this as a general guideline. If you use something every single day at home but its not on my list- don't automatically assume you have to leave it at home. 



Have a safe move-in! ",101,316,1158.4045055505053,college
Statement from the University of Pennsylvania on the college admissions scandal.,"&#x200B;

[Statement from Penn regarding admissions scandal](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/a-statement-from-the-university-of-pennsylvania-regarding-the-college-admissions-bribery-scandal?fbclid=IwAR1cDwrdFb6skRsdduzhqT81Kz4uyPpcop8bxUqIYA5hf-4RqN_HB6AEDT8)

////Edit: Here’s the actual text////

When we learned that at least 50 people participated in a massive college admissions scam, deploying fraudulent means to get their children into our nation’s elite universities, **we were appalled, disgusted, and outraged that not a single one of them was using these deviant tactics to get into the University of Pennsylvania.**

It is just despicable that these privileged, wealthy families, who already enjoy every advantage, would be so deceitful and unethical in their efforts to secure a coveted spot at Yale, Stanford, or Georgetown, but not at Penn, which — friendly reminder! — is an Ivy League school. It’s extremely exclusive. Very difficult to get into. Definitely harder than Georgetown and sometimes harder than Stanford; it sort of depends on the year.

What’s especially appalling to us, as one of the finest academic institutions in the world, is how many of these students did not even care about their education. We’re looking at you, Olivia “I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend” Jade. Well, Olivia, maybe you’d feel differently if you learned about a certain someone named Benjamin Franklin, who founded the University of Pennsylvania in 1740 and also invented bifocals, the Warby Parkers of his day. You could say Ben was America’s first influencer. People already do, actually. It’s a thing. Tell your friends!

As long as you’re going to send a photo of your unathletic daughter on a rowing machine along with a check for $500,000 to a crew coach, why not send it to our crew coach? We have a river here. It’s pretty famous. Probably you’ve heard of it? The Schuylkill. Yes, that’s how it’s spelled. You say it like, skoo-kull. It’s a really lovely body of water and a great place for your daughter to pretend to be a coxswain while she just sits in a boat and vlogs. We would never have accepted the bribe, obviously, because that would go against our code of conduct. We hate crime; that’s why our law school is so good. But it would have been nice to be asked.

Paying $15,000 so the proctor will change your daughter’s SAT answers after she takes the test? Horrifying. But not as horrifying as going to such extreme lengths just to get your kid into USC when you could have sent those doctored transcripts to Philadelphia, PA. That’s where we’re located, just FYI. Like, you knew that already for sure but in case you’d forgotten: We’re in Philadelphia! What a town. It’s such an underrated city. Definitely better than wherever Wake Forest is. (Virginia? New Hampshire?) We’re biased but we can say, with total confidence, that Philly is better than New York. People say that all the time when they visit. They’re like, “Wow, this is so much cooler than I thought it was going to be! I guess my expectations were very low?”

A few days after the scandal broke, people started to talk about the Trumps and we were like FINALLY. But it turned out everybody was just giving Jared Kushner shit for paying $2.5 million to get into Harvard. HARVARD IS A GLORIFIED FINISHING SCHOOL. For fuck’s sake, what about all the money Trump promised he would donate to Penn so his daughter Ivanka and one of his dumb-dumb sons could go to Wharton?? Wharton is a Penn school, and sure, sometimes it bothers us that the Wharton brand is so strong while the Penn brand is still sort of confusing to a lot of people, but whatever. Tiffany went to the College of Arts and Sciences, by the way. At Penn.

Our only consolation in the face of this devastating news is that these criminals, whose schemes were a shameful violation of what is intended to be a fair, meritocratic process, will be brought to justice, **and that none of them bothered to scam their way into Cornell.**",17,320,209.15719073569056,college

I think my posted exam score was wrong,"So I got a 90 on the first exam and for this test I felt the same about it, studied the same, and I was confident.

How can I throw a successful college party?,"My college has a very isolated yet cliquey vibe with not much of a social life, and I really want to throw an event to bring my dorm hall (or even entire dorm building if I’m feeling ambitious) together for some fun. 

I’m thinking of starting with a back-to-school game-night party; we have a nice patio space that no one uses. I used to help set up movie nights at my old college as a member of Hall Council and most of them were successful, but we don’t have a hall council here, and I don’t know how to do this as a single hostess, or how to gather some organizing help. I’m also introverted, but I do open up at a good social event, so this will help me, as well.

What advice do you have to give for throwing a fun college party? How do I get a good amount of people to come? How do I keep them entertained so that they stay a while? Is there anyone that I should get permission from or any rules to follow? And how do I overall throw a good party, especially as the new kid that no one knows?

Also, what are some fundraising ideas, or how to have a good time for cheap? No hall council=no funds (our Rez life really is that sad).

It’s also important to note that because of regulations above me, I can’t bring or have alcohol. 

Thanks!",62,313,86.42752638383872,college
it's happening.. i'm going to graduate,"It's the middle of my final semester and it hit me today that i'm actually going to graduate in December. My academic regalia came in the mail (i brought online early in case i needed to exchange anything) and I put it on to make sure it fit.

College is depressing.,"Just got back from getting dinner at a dining court and realized how alone I am. It’s a nice night, so I was surrounded by people with their friends going to parties and events. Now I’m just sulking in my room. It’s so painful to be surrounded by people having fun. I have tried everything to make friends including approaching people, joining clubs, etc. I just can’t do it. I know lots of people go through this, but it feels so alienating. I was pretty sociable in high school, so I’m not sure what my problem is now. I’m still in touch with a lot of my friends from back home, but I have no one here. Every week is spent just watching YouTube videos, eating, going to class, and sleeping. Anyways, I just needed to get this off my chest. Any advice is appreciated as I’ve tried pretty much everything. ",42,310,724.1369939764313,college
Unusually practical guide for college (xpost from /r/applyingtocollege),"Hi everyone -- I'm a current college admissions counselor and I posted this on /r/applyingtocollege and was told that this subreddit would probably make use of it as well. So I hope they're right and that this does in some way improve your college life. Because of the nature of that sub it's geared slightly toward newer students, but I'm sure that people currently attending can get something out of it as well.

Here is my ""unusually practical guide for college."" It is arranged in no order at all and was completely improvised this evening. I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that. ",24,314,993.5812300875424,college

Does anybody else feel like they are suffocating trying to live in a dorm with another person?,"I’m basically 500% done with it. Everytime I’m doing something I want to do alone my roommate walks in. Honestly always at the worst times. My blood pressure literally rises when she comes in the room because she stresses me out. She is very high energy and squeals and giggles a lot and sometimes handling that early in the morning or any other part of the day is hard. She’s also an international student so she doesn’t leave for breaks/weekends. Every waking day is spent with her. 

I like to be alone the majority of the time and dorm life has taken that away from me and put someone I can barely tolerate in its place. I don’t want to be mean to my roommate or anything, and I try to keep it nice and peaceful bc my logic for being annoyed with her is based solely on the fact that she exists. I can’t get away. It’s not escapable and it drives me crazy. I will just be relaxing in the room totally at peace and then she comes in and there goes that. I don’t want her to think I’m leaving the room because of her but when she comes back I have to get out or I’ll go crazy. Phew I just need my peacefulness back and I don’t know how to get it.

I need at least a full week to recharge from having to be around her all the time, and going home doesn’t count because that’s not exactly a vacation either. I stopped going home because home isn’t a happy place for me but now there’s no way for me to get a break.

"I just realized yesterday that this entire time, my degree hadn’t been conferred. What to do?","finished all of my classes in December 2017.

Paid off my bill, applied for graduation, all paperwork submitted and walked between March-May 2018.

I hear no word from my university’s registrars office or my department head. Not in my school email, physical mail, nor personal email. Nada. My account never at any point showed if my application for graduation had been rejected. 

Now it’s June 2019, I’m in the middle of applying to graduate schools. I call my school to request for a transcript and they tell me that my transcript won’t show that I’m a conferred student. Additionally, since it’s been just about 2 years, I am an “inactive student”.

I broke out in tears. I’m so sad that my school failed me but I’m also aware that I failed myself by not being as persistent. I never got my diploma, I just assumed that you had to order one and I never did. 

I just don’t want my degree to show that my degree was awarded in summer of 2019 even though I’ve been finished with classes since December’s 2017. When I had given my advisor all of my paperwork he told me that I was “all set to graduate” so I can’t see why my application would be denied. Nonetheless, I was never informed until yesterday.

They told me to email the head of my department and I did. No response. 

I’m freaking out someone please tell me that I’ll be fine.

Update: heard back from head of department. He said that the last email he sent to my now deactivated school email address was from January 2018 about my concentration. Had my graduation application been denied for anything having to do with my major classes, it would’ve been him informing me. 10/10 for my department head for getting back to me quickly & helping me on a Saturday in late June. 

I’m more hopeful now but still nervous. You guys are great for helping me out with this :)

Update: problem fixed. I actually was never informed by my department and informed (very late) by the registrar. I was behind in a humanities course, a total curve ball considering that I had a bunch of philosophy classes. So they just added one of my extra philosophy classes and certified my degree 😎

I hope you enjoyed this read. It was very terrifying and embarrassing but I learned a huge lesson in taking control in my life. I should’ve reached out to the university after commencement.

Because of that, I want to share my experience to hopefully help a future reader with his freshman year at college...

A year ago, I made a decision to go to college and to prepare for it as much as I could so that it would be one of the best experiences of my life. So I started browsing around this sub, watching youtube videos, reading blogs, and basically getting my hands on every college preparation resource I could.

I found a lot of very interesting tips and opinions, so I formulated my own ideas and goals and tried to stick with them as much as I could.

I woke up several hours before my first class so that I could have adequate time to have breakfast and to get to campus (it's a community college, so it has no dorms).

I arrived at the college one hour early, I made sure I knew where the classroom was, and then I sat down in some chairs outside of the classroom waiting for the class to begin. Since I'm an introvert, I tend to keep to myself and not be very social in public. But I promised that this time it would be different, so I gathered all the courage I had, and started talking to a guy that was sitting next to me. It ended up being a great conversation, we talked about the interests we shared and about our college experiences.

Ten minutes before the class I entered the classroom and I sat in the front row. The class was English Composition 1, the professor gave us an introduction to the class, went over the syllabus, and then he started with the class material right away. 

I tried to do the best I could to participate in class, answering the question the professor gave us and being an active listener.

During the class, I noticed which students were paying attention in class and being active participants, so that at the end I could walk up to them and try to start a study group with them.
 
After the class ended, I walked up to the professor and introduced myself. Then, I walked to a student who seemed to be interested in the class, and I told her about the study group. She ended up accepting and then proceeded to share her contact information with me. 

That was it! If you made it this far in the post, I love you, thank you for taking your time to read about my experience. I hope that if you are about to start college this post can help you.

I want to thank every person from this sub, you guys are great people.

Should I be worried?,"Last night, I was watching a movie in the common room of my friend's dorm building. There were about ten people I knew there fairly well, and then a girl off to the corner that I wasn't familiar with at all. While we were waiting for the movie to load, I made a joke that was definitely bordering on insensitive and distasteful. I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong, because I did; everyone behaves differently when with a group of friends.

Amidst the laughter, the girl in the corner called me out for what I had said, saying it was something that should never be joked about it. She ended her speech with, ""and I'm an RA, so..."" Not looking for an argument, I quickly apologized, explained that it was a touchy subject that I myself have lived through, and left it at that. Everyone did a great job at moving the conversation forward to make it less awkward for me, but the girl kept stewing in the corner. I could physically feel her staring at me all night.

Throughout the course of the night, she kept making references to how much she liked the authority of her position, how much satisfaction she got out of writing up reports on people with infractions, that sort of thing. I thought it was very unprofessional for someone in her position, but besides that, incredibly worrisome.

Finals start in basically a week and a half. The last thing I want to worry about some RA who I was never formally introduced to gunning for me because of a joke. Has anyone been in this sort of situation with an RA flexing their power? Did they follow through with their promises? If she were to report me, what sort of thing should I expect? I've never had any disciplinary hearings or anything like that.  

EDIT: I'll just throw out what I said, since a handful of people have asked. We were watching *The Dark Knight Rises*, and I remarked something along the lines of, ""Batman would have a whole other set of problems if it was called *The White Knight Rises*."" The RA assumed I was being racist until we explained the definition of a ""white knight"" on the internet, and she grew even more furious upon hearing the meaning. ",68,306,540.4998180505054,college

Advice on school/work full time... No high school experience at all,"I'll be attending college for the first time this spring semester. I've been out of school for over a decade and I've never actually attended high school. Naturally, I'm pretty nervous.

Unfortunately, I haven't been in school since 8th grade. I have no experience writing essays/projects/presentations or even being in any type of upper-level classroom setting. I've studied for the last 6mos or so to learn what I need to pass the GED tests. My goal was to pass and go to college and get a better job. 

I'm registered for online Intro to Biology, a developmental math class which is also online and a campus English class from 6 pm to 8:40 pm once a week. It's 11 credits and i work fulltime M-Th 6 am to 4:30 pm. I have 3 days off. 

I know many students take much more than this but I feel I'm literally jumping into this blind. I have written a total of 2 ""essays"" in my life and that was in middle school. (English is what I'm most worried about. It takes me a ridiculous amount of time to write anything at all and I'm not too thrilled about presentations and all that) I have no credit whatsoever, so I have to take all the intro courses and my major is very science heavy. I want to graduate on time but I cannot quit my job. I'm torn between taking it slow because of work and going head-on with school and work full-time. I self-studied everything from the bottom up to pass the GED. I can handle my time efficiently. I'm most worried about doing well in my classes. 

Has anyone jumped into college-level classes with little to no high school experience? Is 11 credit hours too much my first semester? If anyone could tell me their thoughts about my situation... if you yourself or you know someone in a similar position. Thoughts? Advice?

"Recently graduated. Here are some tidbits of ""wisdom"" I picked up over my time as an undergrad.","1): It's *okay* to skip class, but you have to be methodical about it. If your professor is basically just reading aloud from a textbook that you can read yourself, a skip now and then is fine if you need to work on something else or if you're genuinely exhausted and need to rest a little (You're not going to get much from a lecture in that state anyway). 

2): Sometimes ""studying smarter"" is accepting the fact that you have a janky professor who contrives exams out of thin air, and not wasting time studying material that you and everyone else knows will NOT be on the exam. I'm not saying you shouldn't study *at all* in cases like this, but you need to allocate your time using common sense.

3): No matter how introverted you are, try and get least least one texting buddy per class. It helps to have someone to discuss the material with, and it can be a Godsend on homework sometimes.

4): Virtually everyone procrastinates, so don't feel guilty about it. That said, a lot of procrastination comes from simple psychological walls that are easily gotten rid of (keeping your books in your bag as opposed to taking them out when you get home, for instance).

5): If you're planning on going to grad school, be proactive asking professors for reference letters ahead of time, and don't wait until your last year/semester. Waiting isn't really a big deal if you did well in the class and know the professor, but if you're proactive, it makes the whole process of collecting references less of a task when the witching hour comes.

6): It's perfectly okay to have a good time every now and then for the sake of the ""college experience"", but never forget why you came to school to begin with. I've seen too many people with great potential post images and videos of themselves on social media at frat parties almost every night (And as you might guess, not many of them finished school).

I study a lot and I get grades like 5/10. In some classes I can barely understand what the professor says.

The study strategy I used to succeed in Grad school,"A recent grad student, I used the following technique to learn fast and study much more effectively. I wanted to share this strategy with others who are going into exam season :)

The Feynman technique was developed by Richard Feynman, a Nobel prize-winning physicist known as the great explainer. The Feynman technique is a mental model that allows average people with little knowledge in a subject to understand it quickly and retain their newly acquired knowledge. Richard Feynman was not born a genius or even with a higher than average IQ and in fact he was quoted saying “I was just a normal person who studied hard”. While Richard as an individual was average, his ability to clearly explain difficult and complex topics was far beyond average. This learning technique was the foundation for his greatness and something you should learn if you want to become more efficient when gaining knowledge.

In this article, I will explain the Feynman technique, which you can use to:

• Understand ideas that you don’t really “get”
• Remember ideas that you can understand but forget on tests
• Minimize your study time by learning and mastering information in less than 20 minutes and retaining this information for years to come!

Now, let’s look at the four steps of the Feynman Technique:

► Pick a topic and start studying
The first step in this technique is to pick a topic and begin to write down everything you know about the topic. As you continue your studies, you must add the new pieces of knowledge to your page and eventually you will begin to have a good listing of all the ideas that relate to your topic of interest.

► Pretend to teach your topic
It has been said that you don’t really understand a topic until you can teach it. Teaching the material you are trying to learn has two benefits. Firstly, it forces you to simplify the ideas you are trying to comprehend since you cannot relay the concepts to another person word for word. Secondly, when you attempt to relay the newly learned information to another individual you are better able to gauge your level of understanding and find holes in your comprehension. If you do find weaknesses in your understanding you can then move onto step number 3.

► Improve your areas of weakness
Identifying weaknesses in your comprehension is essential to mastering a subject. While teaching the material, jot down your areas of weakness and refer back to your materials to fill in the gaps. Once you have reviewed your shortfalls you can then take another attempt at teaching them until they become engrained in your mind.

► Simply and analogize
To move along your mastering of the new subject, you should be trying to simplify the content you are learning. The more you can distill complex concepts, the easier it will be for you to keep the ideas straight in your mind. Furthermore, if you can keep things simple, you will have an easier time explaining the topic to others as they will lack the insight that you’ve amassed over time. This simplification step allows you to retain the information in the long term as the content will not weigh as heavy in your mind as you will have it understood at the most refined level avoiding the annoyance of learning material only to forget it days later.

I’m 19 and my parents want me to download life360 (tracking device app),"I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE HELP ME OUT.

I am seriously tired of their bullshit. They don’t let me go out with my friends and now they want to track me even though I am in school? I have a long ass break from 10-2 and I want to hang out with my friends outside of the campus. Is that too much to ask? For me, it’s just an invasion of privacy. This Tuesday, I am planning to go to Disneyland with my friends because all of my classes got cancelled. My question is how do I trick life360? Should I tell my parents no? What would you guys do? I seriously need help. I just don’t like being tracked.

Edit: 
My parents told me that if I don’t download the app, they wouldn’t let me use their car (I pay for the lease every month) to drive to school. Which leaves me to take Uber but they don’t like that idea also. This is just too much for me.

They tell me it’s for safety purposes. It may be true but I feel like it’s more to control me. C’mon I’m in college, I want to go to places without my parents or without them knowing.

My parents threaten me (particularly my dad) that if I don’t do the things he say, he’ll kick me out of the house. One instance that I remember was when he asked me if he could borrow 300 USD from me. I said no because I have a lot to pay for (lease of the car, parking on campus, books, etc). He got mad and he spat on my leg. He threatened me that he’ll kick me and crash the car because I didn’t lend him the money he wanted.

Didn't get into major I wanted but unqualified friend did... Don't know what to do,"So I go to a really good public school where we declare/apply for our majors usually the end of second year. I was going to major in Global development Studies, which only has the pre-reqs of Econ 1 or 2, and a ""global"" class. I took Econ and got an A in it, and 2 global classes and also got A's. I worked reallyyy hard for that. I also volunteered a lot with and did a lot of migrant work relating to what I want to do with this major and career. I applied for the major... and was not accepted. The rejection email was an unformatted, quick email that literally said ""Sorry, you weren't accepted to ___ major. Our applicant pool was great and we regret to inform you of this decision."" 
I was devasted, but even more hurt when I found out who did get in. 

A girl I know here had a rough start to college. She had a 1.2 GPA first semester, then a 3.4 GPA 2nd semester, then a 2.2 GPA 3rd semester. We both were in the ECON class 3rd semester and she got an F, despite literally cheating on a lot of assignments. She didnt take Econ 2 and wasnt in ANY clubs or jobs related to this major. Some ppl apply to this major because it has less requirements to complete and that was the reason she did as well. She is rich and her dad is an alumnus who knows 2 directors of the program (she told me this). She applied with a ~2.3 GPA and incomplete PRE REQ to apply and was waitlisted. She told me she's going to get in because she's going to speak to the directors... and then she was accepted. 

THEN, there are study abroad trips related to the major, and she was selected (min 3.0 GPA to even apply) to a major-related program for the summer.


I'm honestly so confused and hurt. I always knew that people in this school had connections to get ahead but this was the major I really wanted and though I know she probably didn't take my spot, I'm really really hurt and I feel disgusted by this school. But my school is known for things like this, connections giving people opportunities over others, and there was a scandal with a ""watch list"" for applicants from big donor families. I don't even know if I should speak to someone at my school about this or not or just take my loss.

"During the midterm, a student awkwardly began berating the professor...","It's definitely that time of year.

Class difficulty ramps up quickly, exams pile up, and grades may or may not be going one's way. This is a particularly hard semester for me, but I wouldn't imagine having an audible breakdown during an exam, let alone directed at the professor.

It was the Differential Equations midterm, and it had a disturbingly low amount of questions. There were only four! But hey, it didn't seem so bad. Two substitution problems, one multi-part slope field analysis problem, a separable population equation problem, and a separable newton's law of cooling problem. I thankfully did the review and practiced the latter two problems, so I wasn't caught off guard by anything.

One of my classmates, however, was.

Each time he went up to the professor for a question, his tone became more distressed and beleaguered. He was speaking fairly loudly by the second (or third) time he approached the teacher. Before long, he began calling the professor dishonest for not making the review like the exam, and explained how much it ""stressed him out and gave him anxiety"". Christ, he was going on and on, and the professor took 100% of it! Every second he spoke was a lethal dose of cringe...I couldn't focus.

Then, when the exam finished, the student *gave even more* to the professor! He kept going on and on...but kudos to my professor for keeping his cool and tolerating that dude's sass.

At what point do I become worried about my roommate's introverted nature?,"Hello, I am a freshman that just moved into his dorm in college and i love it so far. I do have a concern for my roommate though. Just from texting I knew he was a quiet guy shy guy, which I have problems with myself so I completely get it. He told me more in detail about that when we met, saying how hes very introverted, didnt have plans to party or go to football games etc etc.  and I told him I would give him space if he wanted but if he ever wanted to go to the gym or out somewhere I would be happy to go. 

Its been 3 days now and I'm almost positive he has only left the room once, and that was to take a math placement exam. All hes been doing is sleeping playing video games, watching anime, or doing summer review work(so basically like your average redditor). For meals he has a fridge of stuff and really likes peanut butter sandwiches. He still showers and stuff but I am worried about him. Of course when classes start he will have to get out, so I am not that worried yet, but I want to ask if there is a point where I should try and help him to get out more or just let him be.",52,277,418.18320925420903,college
Is $1k too much to spend on a dorm?,"I went on [dormify.com](https://dormify.com) and got pretty much everything on their dorm checklist and my total ended up being $1240.

Part Two of A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,"Well since my first college tips post blew up so much I thought I would make a second list of college tips from a recent graduate that I thought of the last few day. 

Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cug62h/a_former_students_top_tips_for_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

1. Make Friends with People a Semester or Two Ahead of You

They can give you great advice on what professors to take and can give you their old test/ notes. Also you may be able to get textbooks (PDF or Book Versions) off of them which will save you a ton of money. 


2. Create a LinkedIn Account your Freshman Year and Add as Many Students as You Can Throughout Your Degree

Don’t worry about not having anything to put on there. Just add some class projects that you  have worked on, your high school part time job, and/or some softwares that you have used. The point of the Linked In account college is not to show what you have done but to make connections for later on in your career. Just add as many people as you know on there so when you do have something to show they will see it. There are many people that you will forget about and who will also forget about you so make those everlasting connections on social media early. College students are more likely to add you when they first create a LinkedIn than when they have a job and never check it. I would even say add the people that you are friends with on other social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, or what ever the kids are using now days. The more other people see you, the more likely they are to remember you when it matters. 
Also take the time to take a good profile picture. You don’t have to be in a suit. All you need is  something professional and you can update the picture as you upgrade your wardrobe. Almost any phone camera can take a decent picture now days so have a buddy take a picture of you on a plain background. What ever you do don’t use a selfie for your LinkedIn Profile pic. 


3. Sit in the Front Row

Sitting in the front row helps you get more involved in the class since you are right up next to the professor. People sitting in the front row are generally more engaged in the class and are willing to talk to you for networking purposes. Also the professor will more likely see your face so they are likely to remember you if you go and talk to them. All the intelligent people I knew in my classes sat in the first two rows so if you wanted to try and make friends in the class this may be a good place to try and make friends. 


4. Always Submit Documents in PDF and not in Word Format. ESPECIALLY RESUMES 

The main reason for this is that with a pdf the format of your document will not get messed up so it will look better. Second reason is the person grading it will not be able to see all the metadata (time document was first created, how long the document was worked on, and when it was last revised). I actually had professors call students out based on their metadata. Third reason is a pdf is a lot easier to work with for a grader when they are attempting to grade it. 

5. Buy a refurbished computer/tablet on amazon instead of buying one new. 

To save a bunch of money I got a refurbished powerful dell computer from amazon that was plenty powerful enough to run my programs. I also got a refurbished tablet so I could take notes on. I would also recommend getting a tablet because it was nice to be able to copy the example from the pdf book or lecture notes directly to my notes and write out the solution. It was also great because I never had to buy another notebook again. 

I hope this helps you out some and if you want me to further explain, just let me know! Also, let me know if you want me to make a part three.",25,270,48.497514809764645,college

 I'm 22 and about start uni (again). I've been struggling lately with feeling as though I'm ""a step behind."" I'll graduate by the time I'm 24-25. Given the time of year it is, I've been seeing so many pictures of people graduating who are my age or just slightly older and it's been getting to me. I've had some very cool life experiences during the past few years so I don't regret not taking the more traditional path but it makes me self-conscious sometimes to see all my friends graduating while I'm just starting school back up. So, what age did you guys graduate at (undergrad)? Anybody in a similar situation? 

Also, how many people who either are around my age (or when you were in your early 20s) know/knew what it is you wanted to do with your life? Some people seem to know exactly what it is they want to do, and sometimes talking with those kinds of people makes me feel like I have should have already figured that out by now. I do have set interests, passions, and hobbies, I just haven't quite figured out what it is I want to do with them yet.

How I won over $100k in scholarships (by somebody who isn't getting paid to market to you),"Last year, I earned enough private scholarships to completely pay my four year 18k/year tuition plus living expenses - but it was hard because there were barely any genuine resources to help me find them. My guidance counselor also literally told me *not* to apply to a scholarship I ended up winning. It really pisses me off that there are so many shitty blogs and companies trying to make a buck off of students trying to find money for college, so here are my *real* tips for finding scholarships. I've posted this as a comment to a few posts, but hopefully it will reach more people like this.

Finding scholarships:

* Focus on small local scholarships that won't have many applications - these are the scholarships people always say don't even get claimed because nobody applies to them. If you're in/near a major city, there is probably a specific Community Foundation that indexes and manages many of them. Check [this website](http://www.cof.org/community-foundation-locator) to find one for your neighborhood. You can also try just googling ""[My City/State] Scholarships"" and looking through the first 5-10 pages to see what comes up.
* If you are religious, check with your pastor and the local/state/national governing bodies of your religion. Check with the bosses and websites of you and your parent's workplaces. See if the local library has resources. Ask the teachers at your high school.
* Once you begin college, check with your professors and your major's department office. If you attend a research university, grants for independent research projects are another good way to get money for school - check with the Honors College, Office of Undergraduate Research, or similar offices.
* [Cappex](http://www.cappex.com) was great for me because it has the most ways to sort through their thousands of scholarships (as opposed to FastWeb). It also has settings where you can sort by lack of competition and length of applications/essays.
* If you fit the requirements, you can apply. I got a scholarship funded and named after a football tournament even though I'm a girl that's never played sports in her life. Read the fine print before you write things off.
* Don't underestimate scholarships that don't list how much they're worth. I applied to one thinking it'd be like $500 and it turned out to be $12k renewable.
* Apply to as many as possible, but remember that it's not possible to apply to all of them. You only have so much time, so prioritize it wisely and focus on ones you actually have a serious shot at winning. 

Application tips:

* Fill out your FASFA as soon as it opens in january, because lots of other scholarships will ask for it.
* Turn in scholarships early! Begin looking for spring NOW!
* Draft your essays and get *at least* two people at school to look over them. Read it out loud. Make a draft that's longer than the essay supposed to be, and find bad parts to take out after finishing the draft.
* Be sure to include something in your essays about how the career you're going into will help the community. If you're undecided, just pick one to write about because they know that over 50% of kids switch majors anyway. Obviously don't apply for scholarships specifically for a major you have no interest in, but if it you're just deciding between a couple careers write about the one that is most in-tune with the scholarship.
* Begin getting close to at least 3 teachers/coaches/guidance counselors at the beginning of the year for rec letters, or stay in contact with your old ones. When you ask for rec letters, give them a resume (if you don't have a resume yet, make one!) as well as all the information about what the scholarship is for and where they need to send it. Make copies if you can.
* This should go without saying, but make sure your applications are neat! I have terrible handwriting, so I took the printed copies of applications I found and scanned them to my computer so I could type on them. Things like bad handwriting/scratching stuff out, not following basic instructions, forgetting one of the listed items (like a transcript or even a picture), and not spending the extra $1.50 to mail a manilla envelope (folding everything into a tiny envelope) makes a more of a difference than you would think. It shows that you're unprofessional and don't care.

My College Notetaking Guide.,"Hello all,

I am a 3.9 GPA Mechanical Engineering student in my 2nd year, and over the years I have developed some very helpful and efficient methods for notetaking. 

Before I start, I will say that taking notes this way will require slightly more paper be used up, but at the end of the day it's worth it.

1) Write notes in small sections, starting with the main point, then bullet points off of that, then bullet points off of that, etc etc.

2) In between EACH section, leave 2-3 lines of space in between.

3) Leave 5 lines of blank space at the bottom of each page.

This is my technique for building up on notes. Use the format I just described for taking notes during a lecture. Use the lecture as a general introduction of the topic. Now, many teachers have some material that they are basing their teaching off of, whether it be a powerpoint or a textbook. After a lecture is done, take a look through your powerpoint/ textbook, and add information into each small section, where the 2-3 spaces were provided. Use the bottom 5 lines if you run out of room in one of the other sections, or if you would like to add an example problem from homework that you think is important, or that you might forget later.

A couple more tips:

4) Don't be afraid to write little notes to yourself, even if they seem unorthodox. You are your own best communicator.

5) DON'T forget chapter headings. They will help attach the content to your thought processes. This is more crucial than you would think. You are much more likely to remember what ""Fluid Dynamics"" is than ""Chapter 24"".

Overall, big theme here is leaving yourself a lot of space on your first time taking notes. You want to build up on those notes, so instead of just adding extra papers later, which will get very confusing, it's nice to set aside room to work with for later on.",30,267,1007.4147601801351,college

"I’m two years into college and I want to change my major, but I have absolutely no background in the major I want to switch to","Sorry if this is a little long this is a complex issue for me and I need to get it all out. TLDR at the bottom if you’re lazy and don’t want to read the whole thing.

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldn’t pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I can’t find interest in my own major it’s a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly it’s been negatively affecting my mental health (I can’t really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so I’ve been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I can’t see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelor’s degree. Again I fell behind because I couldn’t pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result I’ve cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days I’ve enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still can’t bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just can’t find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what we’re learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didn’t tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. I’m already 2 years into chemical engineering, and it’ll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. That’s a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people you’ll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but I’m willing to ask questions. I’m working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so I’d imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

I’d imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. There’s a lot of changes that I’ll have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. I’m sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible I’ll take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

TLDR: Don’t see a future for myself in chemical engineering so I want to switch to video game development, which I do have aspirations in, but I am the most technologically inept person you might meet. Please help me figure out how to make this transition.",60,267,132.3225842542091,college

Anyone closer to their high school friends than college friends?,"I’m nearing the end of my junior year in college and am about to be a senior (seriously, time flies) and I’ve noticed that although I have a fairly good group of friends in college, I’ve never been able to gain a deeper and more loyal connection to them than as I did with my high school friends.

It makes me sad honestly. I came into college hoping and expecting to foster similar, loyal, and trustful friendships as I did in high school but that hasn’t been the case.

My friends in college are good people and honestly hilarious, but I don’t think they really care about being close friends with me. On the other hand, I’m still very close with my friends from high school and it feels weird to be so accepted in one group, but sort of irrelevant in another.

My method of studying as a senior biology major!,"Hi everyone, I'm a senior biology major and thought I'd share my studying method to those of you out there who wonder ""how bio majors do it"". For those of you taking biology classes, please don't drown in hopelessness about how hard the exams are or that you're gonna fail. You can do it as long as you're studying often and effectively. I started out as a clueless freshman failing all of her exams, but I survived and only have 2 semesters left!!

Here's my studying method that I've refined over the past few years:

1. **Get enough sleep**. Yes I know it's hard, but do it. There's no sense in going to class if you're so tired that you can't pay attention. If you're not focused then you can't take effective notes, and that will naturally lower your quiz and exam scores later on.
2. **Take effective notes during lecture**. No, don't write down everything the powerpoint slide says word for word if you already have access to that online. Print the powerpoint slides and take them to class (or use a tablet like me), then write notes on them. Prioritize the fine details that your professor is spending a lot of time on. 
3. **Ask to record your professor's lectures**. If they give you permission, record every lecture and sit as close to the front as possible for best recording quality. You can do this with free voice recording apps on any phone or tablet. If you use a tablet to take notes with, find an app that records too. (*This really helps with the next step!*)
4. **Rewrite your notes** **at the end of each week of lecture**. I like to do this in a notebook, but typing is fine too. Use the recordings to help you while you do it, by either listening to the entire recording for each lecture or just using it to revisit a topic you don't completely understand. Since rewriting notes is time consuming, it's a good idea to keep up with it by setting aside time at the end of each week. If you get behind, then it will just feel like a chore.
5. **Make a study guide to prepare for exams**. This doesn't have to be fancy, just use blank pieces of copy paper to rewrite key concepts and definitions from your notes that have a high chance of being on the exam. Focus on what's important and get rid of the fluff. Make it as detailed as you want, depending on how detail-oriented previous quizzes or exams were like. If you have extra time before taking the exam, reread your study guides. It's a good idea to keep a planner and give yourself a fair amount of warning before exams creep up.

This is the basics of what I do. Here's how to modify it for upper-level biology classes:

6. **Write down everything you know about each key concept on blank pieces of paper**. Without using your notes. Trying to write from memory will really tell you how much you actually know, and can help you visualize what you need to work on. This is especially helpful for exams that have all short-answer questions. 

7. **Network with other people in your class**. Oftentimes I had stingy professors that never really helped me when I had questions, so it's really important to ask other people in the class for help when you need it.

\*\* Make sure you're asking a specific question about something, not just ""omg I don't get this at all."" No one can help you if you don't even know what you don't know. If that makes sense?

TLDR: I'm a senior bio major and this is how I study. Hours of rewriting things! Yes, I have pretty much no social life and all I do is study, but that's what I signed up for. Other bio majors have different methods, but all of us make study guides before every exam, pretty much. 

Feel free to comment or message me with questions :)

Last semester of college. Should I take a break?,"Hi guys. I am an international business relations student, currently living in Western Europe. Im just about to start my 6th semester, after which I am going to recieve my bachelor's degree. I don't play on continuing my college education after acquiring this degree.

To be completely honest I dread going to school everyday. I made some friends, but most of them have already finished their studies. Most of the courses are purely theoritical so it's the same old bullshit I've been fed for entirety of my education, which doesn't bring any practical knowledge. I study with people who are more than happy to work for some big corporation. That's not me. I'd much rather have my own small business and make most of the decisions myself, rather than have to listen to someone else tell me what to do. Im burned out after studying for the past 15 years of my life. I struggle with some anxiety issues and they intensify drastically due to my studies. It's a vicious cycle of me skipping classes, almost failing, then having to put in extra work to even stay afloat. It's just exhausting. 

Truth is I was never too excited about college, but I listened to my parents and just went with the flow. How was I supposed to decide about my future at 18? I thought it was the right thing to do. Oh yeah also my dad paid quite a lot for my college education so I feel like I have an obligation to actually finish it.

 I know this may seem really dumb but i'm thinking about taking a break from college right now before the last semester. There's only one big obstacle - my dad. As I said he paid for my education and he wants me to finish it, which is understandable. He would also LOVE for me to have a nice paying office job, which I just dread even imagining. His vision and mine of my future are not cohesive at all. He wants me to play it safe and not risk losing any money opening businesses. Im actually starting one next week, but I don't really talk about this with him since he gets butthurt about it. My mom is much more supportive when it comes to starting businesses since she owns one herself. I wanna try working different jobs and travel, but college is just too draining for me. 

What do I do? Should I just make a deal with my dad to finish it next year? Should I finish this last semester now? I need different perspectives. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",54,259,225.4382092542091,college

Anybody else have friends but no core friend group in college?,"I used to have a solid friend group freshman year that I could always rely on to do things with. Now that I'm a sophomore, it seems like everyone has separated and is doing their own thing. I've only stayed close friends with 3 people from that group, who are my roommates now. However, I only actually ever do things/hang out on weekends with one of them, because the other two are always busy/doing their own thing. They only hang out with us when it's convenient for them. I've tried reaching out to some of my old freshman friends, but most of them have their own friend groups now and those that don't never want to go out on weekends. I'm grateful that I have a best friend who I can count on for anything, but on days when she's busy/not here I can't help but miss that old friend group. My best friend is perfectly content with only having one close friend (me) by the way, and says she's not really interested in making new friends, so working on it together isn't really an option. I'm currently trying to make new friends but haven't succeeded yet. And even if I do manage to make a new friend, it still won't be the same as having that dependable core friend group.

Who here had a much harder time making friends in college than in high school?,"I graduated years ago, and I did have trouble making friends. If you had the same problem, were you able to handle that? We couldn't keep up with each others' schedules, and despite the university having roughly 20k students, the classes themselves that I took were mostly tiny. And it was hard to relate to those students. Plus I'd rather go bowling, eat out go to the movies or play Street Fighter at someone's home than go to bars or go clubbing which was promoted a lot in college.

Mostly, though, maybe also because I commuted to college. I didn't live in a college town. This was my hometown growing up so I took the city train every day and it felt more like high school in that way. Except for the part where I made many friends. I felt more connected to people in HS.

"Financial Aid didn't get applied to bill, office closed until after due date?","Hey guys. I got a bill for $27k for the fall semester of 2019. I got a $26.4k in financial aid (in letter) so that reduces my bill payment to $600. However, my university didn't apply any financial aid  to the bill and their office is closed until way past the due date. If I end up missing the payment, I have to hand in another $400 after. I clearly can't pay $27k. Should I just pay the $600, assuming they will take it off the financial aid later?


UPDATE!! I’m so dumb. Kinda. Turns out that I didn’t ACCEPT the financial aid offer. If you are awarded financial aid, you can either accept or decline. I didn’t accept/decline, so it went off as pending and I didn’t get the financial aid. The “kinda” part is that I needed someone else to find the page for me (I hired a guy to do the financial aid stuff for me). I still can’t find it myself. I checked the email award letter, I checked the financial aid website that describes my exact grants and loans I’m getting and such, but the other guy found it for me. I assumed that the financial aid would be placed a little later after I received my bill because it takes some time for the guys in the financial aid office to finalize everything. Oops.

I am considering a job as a school teacher in Texas, USA, and the starting salary is 53k. I would take out 120k of student loan for 2 years of community college and 2 years of university.

Tips for College Freshmen,"I wrote this as a comment in someone's post but decided to make it my own. Basic but great tips for College Freshmen, or College students in general.

1. Don't take classes lightly just because you're a freshman, study and go to class. Don't listen to those who are always acting cool and bragging because they skipped class.

2. If your professor assigns homework, and it isn't graded, do all that homework and make sure you do it all right. Those questions will 9/10 times appear on your exams and/or quizzes.

3. Take breaks when studying, not 80 hour breaks, but reasonable breaks for long study hours.

4. Don't, Don't DONT DONT DONT DONT DONT Procrastinate, they say money is the root of all evil, in college, procrastination is the root of all evil. If you have an exam in 2 weeks, plan for it, study slow, take your time, 3 days before review, day before review, and then take the exam. Don't wait till its 8pm on Sunday while you're watching Friends on Netflix and still considering studying for your 8:30am class. Don't do this, trust me, trust me, trust me, it hurts and it hurts alot when you knew you had the chance but wasted it.

5. If your stuck, ask for help.

6. Make study groups, join study groups, start a study group.

7. Don't sleep on trying to get internships early and getting your game on, you will look way way way better than all the current freshmen with you. Just try, you won't lose anything. Go to career fairs, network with people there, even if you don't want an internship right now try to get some companies interested in you, show that you're serious and of value.

8. Don't be the that person who goes all 4 years not socializing or talking to anyone, it hurts. Join clubs ( I didnt join clubs even though I wanted to so badly, I'm an idiot for not doing so, I completely regret it, well I still can tbh lol ) You'll make friends, gain experience while having fun, be involved, and enjoying your time. Note that clubs are not your only option, talk to random people on campus, people in class, go to school events, have lunch with a stranger (who knows he might be into all the weird any crazy stuff you're into), if you can, try to join a sport, go to school games, etc. 
My freshman year I was sick of keeping myself in my comfort zone and literally walked around campus talking to completely random people I have never met or talked to before in my life. I would ask someone where the library was just to start up a conversation, when it was in clear sight in front of both of us, lol.

9. Get some part-time job, it'll teach you responsibility, I'm still in college and I started working more this year and it is indirectly helping me plan and implement things, and manage my time. Preferably a job or volunteering related to your major, paid or unpaid the experience and responsibility is way more valuable than the money.

10. Stay physically healthy, go to the gym, workout, run, exercise,sweat, swim, this will keep your body and mind healthy. 2 birds with 1 stone, don't miss.

10. Have fun, its college, if you don't feel like going to parties you don't have to. I never went to a college party, currently a Junior, and don't really intend on doing so. Theres so much more you can do, plan a guys or girls night, movie night, go skiing, game night, go out to NYC, see if any cool events are going on on campus, play ball at the gym, swim, go bike riding, explore campus (this is actually fun to do alone, you'd be surprised with what you can find) 

Overall Story: Don't waste College, have fun, enjoy your time, use it wisely (USE YOUR TIME WISELY, WISE-LY, W I S E L Y)

**People are talking in the comments and saying how I shouldn't give advice because I don't go to college parties and that I'm not implementing these because i don't go to college parties. It was my decision whether or not to go to parties, I have friends who go to parties and have no problem with them. I was friends with the DJ at the parties and still didn't go. I was childhood friends and still currently am friends with one of the frat leads, but I still didn't go to party. I simply don't want to go to one and prefer having fun in different ways. Having ""fun"" doesn't only mean going to a party, there's much more you can do. If you feel like going to a party, go ahead, if that's what you like and enjoy, then do it. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with that too.**

"Chinese Student are selling SAT answer to cheat, this is how.","Ok, First, I want to let you know that I am a Chinese student, I know all this information from the people around me, these friends of mine. I know personality, people who are selling these answers to my other friends. English is my second language, If you see me making some grammar mistakes, plz just keep that in mind.

I don’t even think this is possible until a few months ago, When I joking ask how can I improve my SAT score to one of my friends on WeChat, She just told me that I can buy answer from her. Of course, I was like that is not possible, But she told me that She was serious, and she only sells this answer for the people that are “in need”. Then she shows me some screenshot images of her that making deal with other people on SAT answers. I still don’t believe it, not people this close to me at least. So I ask one of her friends, and he said he don’t know anything about it. I guess her friend ask her about it, but now She is really mad at me that I tell other people about it. 

I am disgusted, And I did my research, and this is how they did it: They are taking advantage of the US time zone. In Los Angeles, time is always a few hours short than say New York, but SAT always started at the same time, around 8:00. That means when people in New York finished Section 1, People in LA didn’t even start the test yet. So people in New York just sneak a note card or something with them to copy all the answers, and during the first break, they go to the restroom and send the answers with the Phone that they sneak with them. People in LA usually get their answers around 6-7 in the morning. You might think that the answer must be different between New York and LA, but guess what, the entire US are the same, this is so easy to fix and why didn’t the College board fix it is beyond me.

If this is news to you, you might be shocked, and I was as shocked as you are. There are organizations doing these dirty work. I am Sorry, I don’t think this is fair for anyone…...and I think people from my culture are better than this…... I did some research on the internet, and I didn’t find anything about this situation.

I know good people, hard working people who didn’t get the college they want to go, but some dawdler, who won’t come to school when there is a test, but have friends help them when making it up, and get a high score on it. I consider myself pretty hardworking person, I teach myself about computer hardware, networking, I help my guardian in his company with some IT work, I learn Linux myself, even made an raspberry pi VPN server so that I can bypass school network’s firewall, And well I didn’t get into the college I want to go, Yet my friend who came to high school in Junior year from China, and got his grade transferred got in. Here is the thing, Because Chinese college doesn’t care about the grade, they just care about the Gao-Kao (like a Chinese SAT) score, if you get a good score on this test, you get in good college. If not, you screwed. So the High school in China you can actually pay some money and let the school change the grade, which can be transferred to the US. I actually have a friend in China did exactly that and now studying in England.

Don’t get me wrong, I love this Country, that is the reason I come here in the first place, But I think the Education System is not good, and college is doing a terrible job. And it can be fixed.

Do you recommend taking 12 or 15 credits a semester?,"Hello,

As I finalize my schedule for the Spring, I am curious as to how many credits other students normally take in a semester.

I am a second semester Sophomore and I generally take 12 credits (4 classes) per semester. I find that if I take more than that I cannot give all my courses the necessary attention that is required and I become even more stressed and overwhelmed. However, I do realize that this will probably extend my graduation date beyond 4 years. I am considering taking 15 credits (5 classes) next semester, but I am hesitant.

How many credits do you normally take in a semester? Do you recommend taking fewer credits to make the workload more manageable or more credits to graduate on time?",160,240,281.5314615690239,college

I feel like I’ve messed up any chance I have of going to college and then eventually going to get school.,"Fair warning this is very long and I’m looking to get some advice on what I should do. Thanks in advance! 

I started out in college at a technical school because I lacked one math credit to get into a 4 year college. My plan was to go that technical school for a year and then transfer to a 4 year college with the plan of majoring in biology or pre-vet. About 2 months into the courses I fell into a deep hole of depression and I ended up having to withdraw because I ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks. After that I decided I wouldn’t go back to school right away and I got a job. Around January of 2018 I decided that I wanted to go back to school but this time I wanted to go to art school. I thought that maybe I couldn’t do normal school so maybe I’ll try this. So I applied to my dream school and a few months later I found out I go accepted. So I started at that school in the fall of 2018 and I did really well! I got an honors scholarship and my parents were really proud of me and things were great. So I go back to school after winter break and I start out okay but I really start to slip because of depression. I end up failing all 3 classes because of it and I lose my scholarship. My parents were very upset with me and really disappointed. After spring break I go back for spring quarter and once again I slip and I end up failing two classes and passing one but with a “D”.  Towards the end of spring quarter I finally got on a medication that really worked for me and I really tried my hardest to bring my grades up but it was too close to the end of the quarter and I didn’t have enough time. 

As I stated I have depression and I really struggle with motivation. But I really think I struggle so much with motivation because I haven’t found my “passion” yet. But over this summer I started working at a doggy daycare and boarding place and it has really brought out my passion for not just dogs but animals in general. The daycare place I work at has a vets office in it and I spend a lot of time talking to them and asking questions. It really gets me feeling excited. So I really am thinking about going to school to become a veterinarian. I know vet school is highly competitive and hard to get into. But I feel that I would have the motivation now to know that I could be working with animals every day and helping them. 

My problem right now is even getting into a 4 year college. I’m not really sure where to start. My grades are terrible and the credits I have from my college right now wouldn’t transfer. So it would be like I am starting college all over again. And if I used my credits from high school I’m still missing one math credit. I just don’t know what to do and any words of advice would help. I feel like I’ve really messed things up for myself and I know my parents wouldn’t be supportive of this because they don’t believe in me at all. 

Thank you for any advice you may have. I really appreciate it!",22,236,109.35344073569057,college
My lack of education is keeping me out of college,"I'm 26. I graduated high school in 2010 and I've struggled with math my entire life. I mean that as literal as possible, I was put into remedial math classes around 4th grade and that continued until I graduated high school. Teachers in elementary tried to teach me math but my brain and body would literally shut down and I would cry and refuse to do anything. From then on, my remedial teachers taught me little math and passed me though their classes. I was a D student, and my grades were curved (somehow??) and I was able to graduate on time despite never doing my work or understanding anything to do with math. My knowledge stops at multiplication tables. 

&#x200B;

A year ago when I first got the idea to attend university, I attempted to use Khan Academy to educate me in math so that I could pass the SAT and have a shot at a low ranking university. That plan failed, twice. I got a 960 on the SAT my first attempt, and my second attempt as well. At the time I hadn't realized how much math I didn't know.

&#x200B;

I wanted to learn Chinese History and a wide array of languages. I've studied language on Duolingo and I think I've found my knack. Language, reading, and writing come easy to me. I have very little issue remembering the syntax of a language, characters, tone, pronunciation, it's something I truly love and have loved for a long time, but didn't really realize the full breadth of it until a year ago. 

&#x200B;

I have a full time job and money is always tight. All my self-education has come in my off time, provided I don't have other responsibilities to attend to and that I don't lose spirit. I so desperately want to become a full time student at a university and live off loans so that I can be a \*real\* student. I hate having a meaningless full time job that just allows me to survive. I want to become a student so I can truly devote 90% of my time to my language and cultural studies. One day I plan to teach what I've learned, with being an english teacher or a translator as a fall back. I'm interested in the idea of perusing a PhD, or at least a masters in my major, with an array of languages at my back. I've explored many job opportunities for linguists, translators, cultural experts, etc. and I have a knack for teaching. I'm often asked by ESL people at work how something would sound in english, or the proper syntax of a sentence. While I'm not a translator, I can generally understand the meaning they're trying to convey in their sentence. I also have taught people certain aspects of judo (a martial art/olympic sport), IT knowledge, gym stuff, english, and philosophical topics. So I know that teaching is in my heart. 

&#x200B;

I'm realizing this dream has become increasingly difficult, this entire year has been mired by set back; I try something, fail, realize I'm way in over my head, and then I'm knocked back 10 paces. I've slowly learned discipline and perseverance, and while not perfect, I'm better off than I was a year ago, or two years ago. I know to keep trying. But with my education it feels so different, it truly feels like I'm in the negative. 

&#x200B;

My plan is to enter into a community college (Austin Community College), earn enough credits to transfer to University of Houston (I was rejected from UH, but I've been told the transfer requirements), and then study abroad. I even have my sights set on the National University of Singapore, which from what I've heard from many sources, is a great country to study and live in. I've never been outside of my state so the idea of studying abroad and travelling is very appealing to me and I think a fresh restart from this monotony of a life I currently live would allow me to truly recognize my linguistic and educational potential. 

&#x200B;

But this all seems impossible from where I stand. My lack of math has shocked those kind enough to tutor me, and even now as I write this I'm studying number lines, basic algebra, and multiplication tables, all so that I can APPLY for community college. I learned that as an adult my math anxiety did not vanish. I had a mental break down in public, three times, when a friend was tutoring me. I was fighting to hold back the tears, and my mind reverted to a very anxious and afraid state, I was almost like a scared child.

&#x200B;

 If I don't pass the community college's math assessment test, I'll be in remedial/high school math where I wont earn college credits for transfer, and my journey to university will be much longer, which I'm not sure will last. My job pays enough to survive but we all could lose our work over night. It's a full time gig, and I don't know how much I can mentally last at that place. I've already been there for almost 3 years. 

&#x200B;

 That's why I'm so nervous about time, I want to be in uni yesterday so I don't have to worry about this crap. If my journey to uni takes longer, if i have to spend more time at community college while having a full time job.... I just don't know if its possible. My morale is very low because of my life situation and my job, and I think being a full time student is just what I need. 

&#x200B;

So I want to know from anyone who reads this: is there another way? Can I succeed without learning an impossible amount of math? Or am I truly screwed? What alternatives do I have? Is it better to study a ton of math on my own or just accept the fact I'll be in remedial math classes at community college, thus taking longer to get to uni? (I'm not getting any younger...) Are there foreign universities in which I could study my major, the languages I want, while receiving little to no math courses? Math is entirely irrelevant to my major and I know enough to handle money and basic life things. It makes me so mad my education is stymied because I don't know very complex algebraic formula. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I feel lost, dejected, and out matched. I've struggled with math and emotional issues my entire life and it's biting me in the ass as an adult. 

Edit: Wow I got a lot of replies. A lot of it is good information, but it’s a lot to sift through. I’m still catching up on some of it and I’ll reply. I think the best course of action for me might be to take the math assessment and just accept what classes they place me in, remedial or otherwise. I’ll look into seeing some kind of doctor for ADD/ADHD or some kind of math disorder. I’m reluctant to go that route but I’m not closed off to it. I won’t take ritalin again, I have nothing but bad memories of the effects of that medicine, and my parents did not like putting me on it. ",83,240,286.2891814764313,college

I have 2 exams Monday, 1 Wednesday, and a paper due tonight I'm finishing up and I also work tonight. I don't want to miss the opportunity to see her for the last time because I'm constantly studying, but I need to study every moment I can until the exams. Last year I did horribly because of my depression and anxiety. This semester I have it under control and I'm doing extremely well. I've heard so many people talk about the cliche ""dead grandmother syndrome"" and I know how bad it would sound. Maybe I'm just trying to get everything off my chest. I really don't know what to do.

Update:

Thank you so much to everyone for all the advice and kind words, it's been really appreciated. One of my professors happens to be the dean of my college and immediately replied saying it was no problem at all. Still waiting on replies from the others but I found that they do have a makeup exam policy so it should be fine. And to everyone who's had a similar experience, I'm truly sorry for what you've gone through. I'm going to spend some time with my family and focus on exams after fall break.

how to avoid coming home,"my family is really abusive to me and i want to avoid coming home for breaks as much as possible (especially for summer break). i don’t think i can take anymore of this abuse so this is pretty urgent for me. 

because i wont be 18 until into the summer after my freshman year i can’t just refuse to come home without a reason they deem valid (or else they will probably try to call me a run away which in my state can land you in jail). 

my family will also be giving some financial support (i am almost at a full ride with scholarships but there is still a couple thousand a year to pay) so i can’t really say that i’m not coming home because i don’t want to (though i plan to do this when i’m in the right spot financially)

what are some things i can do over each break that will give me a valid reason to not come home?

edit: my college is about 2000 miles away from my house

edit 2: i just got back on and was overwhelmed by the support i’ve received. thank you for all of the good ideas, for sharing your stories, and for generally being great people! going to college this fall and having freedom from my family for the first time will be the best thing ever. thank you :)",37,225,125.16788518013502,college

College tip that I don't think I've seen here,"I'm sure many upper classman already know this but a lot of freshman probably don't. Or at least I didn't know this my freshman year. 

TIP: Make it an effort to attend class on days where attendance is usually the lowest. A lot of students usually skip the class after a big test or a class period just before a holiday. The catch is, a lot of professors will use these days to reward the kids that come to class often by giving out extra credit points or having an in class quiz. 

Obviously, you should attend EVERY class. But I know that for a lot of people, skipping a class every week or two is pretty normal. 

EDIT: As people mentioned below (and I forgot to put in the main post), they might also show you an essay question that will be on an upcoming exam so that you can study for it specifically and not go in blind like the kids that skipped class that day. ",21,221,1081.2719824023573,college

I am accused of peeing on my girlfriends roommates bed. She has no proof. What do I do? (Follow up),"I laid out the situation in this previous thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9cz575/i_am_accused_of_peeing_on_my_girlfriends/?st=JLPNZKYV&sh=69a027c4

Today I met with the RD and I explained a possible theory of mine, which was that the roommate had brought her mini fridge to campus that morning, and perhaps she had placed it on her bed and the ice melt from the freezer had leaked onto her bed, causing a wet spot and a bad smell. She told me that what was on the bed was indeed pee. She said that she could confirm that because she had a campus police officer smell the sheets, and he said it smelled like pee, and that she would believe him because he worked in a penitentiary for 8 years (???). 

I explained the situation from my point of view, saying that I had spent the night but would never think of peeing on somebody’s bed. The RD then proceeded to tell me that she has a threshold of people that she needs to hold accountable for situations such as these and that me and my girlfriend would receive letters in a few days explaining our punishments. 

This seems very illegal and against any possible university policy to come to such a conclusion so quickly with no evidence other than that a police officer smelled the bed and said it smelled like urine. Both urine and freezer fluid smell bad, so it could be possible that he mistook a bad smell for urine. 

TLDR: The RD who I was supposed to meet with told me that the sheet smelled like urine, and since me and my girlfriend were the only people in the room, she has no choice other than to punish us. This seems fast and without due process. How should I proceed?",42,223,404.2372138838387,college
"My best friend dropped out on day 4, how do i support him?","If this isn't the right sub, please redirect me... My best bud started at a good school recently. We're going to different places so we've been staying in touch and he was strangely and increasingly depressed every day. He didn't sound like he was enjoying himself at all. I wondered if this was the right choice for him, despite his academic prestige and his passion for his subject. 

He called me late last night to let me know he was going home and taking all his stuff with him before classes got started. I support him and agree with his decision - he was getting concerningly depressed at this point. He didn't want to waste money on what he felt wouldn't do him well and he wants to take time to sort himself out a bit before going back and giving it another go. Again, super proud, that's a tough decision.

How do I best support him? I'm a big huge academics nerd so the thought of dropping is kind of intangible to me, but I love my friend so much and want to make sure he knows that his decision is genuinely okay and to help him through the societal pressure.

Persisting through a difficult class,"Hey y'all, just wanted to see if anyone feels the same way: I'm taking a class for my major (Econ) that's super difficult for me to understand and it takes me back to taking classes in my least competent subject (math). Very frustrating, very difficult, I have a D+ average on the homeworks of which the questions are taken from old tests, so the upcoming test I have is basically similar to the questions on the homeworks.

&#x200B;

I've been going to office hours, but they proved to be less productive for me as other students would come in at the same time and the professor would be bouncing between 3 to 4 students crowded around a small circle table, each asking 3 to 4 different questions.

&#x200B;

The prof guides students through figuring out the answers when you go to office hours, but I've never had this experience where I was so incapacitated and incompetent with the information that I wasn't able to at least figure out the answer on my own. Homeworks are 20% of the grade and this upcoming exam is 25% of my grade as well.

Confession: I really miss High School,"I miss High School every time I think about it... even though college is going okay. It makes sense because I am only a freshman in college, but I will still always love high school. It feels like things were so much easier academically and socially. Here is a list of the things I miss the most about HS:

1\) My group of friends

2\) The lacrosse team

3\) Hilarious and awesome teachers/admins

4\) The events like pep rally, prom, assemblies

\- My friends were amazing, a lot of them were also my teammates as well. I just miss my old friends who are now either in college, working a job, or in the military. I know we go our separate ways but it sucks to think I will never talk to 95&#37; of them again. I had strong friendships and sad it's over after four short years.

\- Where do I even start with my lacrosse team? I loved these guys like brothers. The brotherhood you feel just being apart of that locker room atmosphere is incredible. I was fortunate enough to be a starter for 2\+ years. I miss competing on that field with my guys every day. Also, my coach was great too. 

\- I had some really awesome teachers/admins who just made my day better. Students often hate on teachers, but I loved most of my HS teachers. They really inspired me to do great things and showed me how to push through when I am struggling. They cared about me because I put in the work.

\- I miss the small and big events that the school would host. Prom of course was great, all my friends and girlfriends hanging out/dancing until like midnight. I also miss some of the pep rallies as weird as it sounds. Everybody just laughing and clowning around in the gym. Yelling ""Go Home Freshmen!"" was hysterical. I miss all of it.

Lastly, do not lecture me on how college is better than HS. All I'm saying is that I really miss HS compared to college. College is alright but it just does not feel the same. If anybody is feeling the same way let me hear your story in the comments! ",57,219,528.5611837912462,college

Found out a couple of months ago that I'll probably die in the next few years; my grades are suffering and I don't know if it's even worth it to continue.,"My parents told me last time I went to visit them (at the start of the year) that my mother's side of the family carries a set of genetic defects, and that I should probably get tested.

It culminates in an overwhelmingly high likelihood of dying before the age of 30, which gives me just over 8 years left to live assuming I survive until 30. 

I haven't told anyone yet because I don't really know what I'm supposed to say, or how to bring it up when I look perfectly healthy. If I do bring it up then I'd have to talk about it, and I don't really want to do that either.

"If you are 18 and about to hit college or are in college, here are some words of advice from someone x2 your age.","I wrote this in response to this image: http://i.imgur.com/mHRCFxY.jpg

While I agree with this advice; I would take it a step further.

Don't freak out; but know that what you are going to be facing in your life is going to be leaps and bounds harder than what your parents went through. Manage your expectations; your life will be a lot harder than theirs was.

If you are 18 today, you were born in 1997. When you were just a small child the internet bubble burst. Then the housing crisis happen in 2007. You were 11 at the time. You didn't care.

Truth is that crash wiped out entire swaths of soon to be retirees as far as financial security for retirement is concerned. As a result they are still working; lessening your upward mobility. Not only that, since a lot of people lost their jobs you had a ripple effect; Software Architects were fired; and some took Senior Developer positions; in turn a lot of those people were fired and they took Mid Level positions; and so on. This caused people entering the work force to face the worst market in decades; not only that but it has put a downward pressure on salaries. In fact, I read a study that showed Millennials are earning 20% less than they should be; and they lost 5+ years of experience by being unemployed.

At the same time tuition costs have skyrocketed; as well as text books. You will most likely leave college with 40-60k in debt before you ever enter the work force; I've known some who had 160k+ in debt because they went to Ivy League Schools. Your parents didn't face that situation; the government has continued to cut public college funds; and that in turn is passed on to you, the student.

While all of this is going on; in the next 20 years you will see entire industries collapse or shrink almost to nothing due to technology, innovation, and automation. Automated cars are around the corner; Uber is replacing taxy companies left and right; AirBnB is replacing hotels; this innovation will continue. Soon we wont need chefs or bar tenders; you already see being able to order food at kiosks so no waiters. You have to choose smartly what profession you choose; instead of what you ""like"" to do; hopefully they are one and the same. Liberal Art Degrees? History? They are great; but the number of people with degrees vs how many are needed is a bad ratio; you will have a bad time finding work or will be making little to no money compared to other degrees, all while having added tens of thousands of debt that you have to pay of.

Ok, so I scared you. What can you do about it? Here is my advice. I am not quite double your 18 years of age, but getting there.

1. Choose a school wisely; limit the debt you gain. Yes Harvard sounds great on your resume; how about having to pay off the equivalent on a brand new house @8%+ for the next 30 years? Unless you are well off, or can get a ton of scholarships; be very careful how much debt you want to get before you have even started your first job.
2. There are top trending jobs that are relatively immune to the next waves of automation. Science, specifically engineering/development will continue to be needed for decades to come. Technology, whether it be helpdesk technicians, network admins, developers, business analysts, that's the hot market right now. The things that require critical thinking and problem solving will be the last to be automated; they are the hardest to teach a machine to perform. That being said Machine Learning is making lots of gains in that area; so be mindful and get there as quick as you can; remember you will always need seniors in positions to watch over the robots; if you get there in time you will be pretty ok job wise.
3. Work Experience and practicing critical thinking skills > a specific colleges' degree. The degree tells an employer you can learn; that's it. Depending if you are on the east vs west coast that degree will matter more(in the east). But at the end of the day that piece of paper can be used as toilet paper in the next 20 years. I don't mean to imply you shouldn't go to college; but choose the institution wisely. As more jobs get automated its you; the individual, and your ability to think that will differentiate yourself from the masses.
4. When you were a kid you were told you have it easy. You did. I wish I had 5+ hours a day to play video games and jack off. In college you think you will have a lot of pressure; it is nothing compared to the real world. Enjoy those 4 years, party, don't add too much debt; not to say it is all down hill after that, but discretionary time will be something you will value more than cash itself. Right now you want cash; later you will want time/freedom.
5. Give yourself until you are 30 to feel financially secure. If by 30 you have 100k put away and a 401k account, perhaps a kid and are married; you are doing really well. Most people are not that fortunate.
6. Take criticism; and don't feel offended especially if it is constructive. Learn from other peoples' mistakes instead of making them yourself; I promise that will make a big difference in the long run.
7. You are facing a daunting future with problems previous generations haven't had to deal with. Capital has won over Labor; simple as that. You wont figure that out until you work 60 hours a week; which is seen as mandatory, and they only give you 2% raises as a ""Reward.""
8. Get into the tech industry; and I mean both men and women, we need more women to help balance the projects output. Your opinion is valued and as more men figure out women will help create a better product, they will get on board as well. Executive level employers who are not 60+ have already figured this out. And jump ship every time you feel you have reached the next level. I don't mean to say you shouldn't give your employer the opportunity to bump your salary, but if they say no move on. Loyalty is now an illusion used to keep the masses placated. You will be able to get 5-10k with each jump. My largest jump was 25-30k.
9. As daunting as it sounds; you have the greatest technology ever made by humanity at your disposal. No analog phones, or beepers, reading books is still important but ""let me google that for you""; Sharpen your brain, that will be your greatest tool for the rest of your life. You have all the information of the world at your disposal; if you can learn to utilize it effectively you will have an edge.",89,220,1462.4130587912462,college

Do you feel like everyone around you is smarter than you?,"I just constantly feel stupid. I make mostly As, but I feel so much less intelligent than the majority of people in my classes. I'm less sharp, I'm less articulate, I'm less creative, and I'm less insightful.
I was homeschooled through high school and I am kind of naive and immature as well, and that doesn't help.
College just makes me miserable because I feel like a fool. I'm in classes where you're supposed to participate a lot, and I always feel like such a fool because the things I have to say are so shallow and stupid sounding compared to other people my age.
I'm a Junior but I feel like a child next to people my age.

Does anyone else get sick to their stomach making big purchases in college because it was rare to not spend a penny growing up in a poor household?,"*rare to ever spend
Oops

Like spending anything luxury over a certain amount makes me sick because of just how much money it is. People in college wearing airpods, $1000 phones, etc and it's just such an odd concept to spend that much money without worrying about anything financially.

Even in my personal life. My significant other grew up in an engineering family, great wages, etc. Can go to Red Lobster and spend $150 like it's nothing. The father wrote me a check to see her for $200 because of being long distance and it's just- $200 in my family would be no food for the next two weeks.

Edit:
As stated below, my grandparents came to America with $0.01 and only spoke Romanian and retired middle class with retirement traveling the world. Of course if you work hard you deserve to have that money. 
My point is that it feels nauseating to finally be able to make large purchases as I grew up largely poor. I'm not bashing on people who have the money to do such as they worked hard, or their parents, etc to get to where they are.",28,213,7.126415272727609,college

Don't worry too much about your public speaking skills. 'Skills' are things you can learn!,"Edit: Please share your tips for giving talks and presentations if you have any. Everyone has to do it for the first time at some stage, but there are lots of things you can do to make it go smoother. Moral of the story: don't dread that debate or speech class!

It's something that's pretty easy to forget. You fall into this trap where you think that your asocial tendencies are a part of your personality. That they're immutable, unchangeable. But really, social and debate skills are just like hand-eye coordination: the more you meaningfully practice, the better you will get. On a related note, some people just seem to have better coordination off-the-bat, some seem to learn it faster, and others will really struggle to get the hang of it. But with social skills, there aren't many targeted exercises you have to do in primary school to help you learn, and if you fall behind then you're either bullied or just ignored. So your problem goes untreated and you fall further and further behind everyone else, convinced that there just *has* to be something wrong or different about you. That doesn't have to be the case.

At 16 years old, I couldn't even talk to a *cashier* because I was so nervous and awkward. I couldn't answer the phone or call anyone. I hated cameras and so there are no photos of me between the ages of 5 and 18. I hung out with people at school but I never made any real friends; the ones I had let me stick around but weren't really interested in me.

And yet today, at 22 years old, I went on national breakfast radio for an interview. I've spent the last couple of weeks speaking in front of nearly 1000 school children and over 200 adults. I've given lectures and run demonstrations, I've eaten bugs on a stage, I've had my photo taken so many times that the cameras are a part of the backdrop now. I have websites and interviews, and yes, I talk on the phone sometimes. And none of it made me nervous or scared.

There's no amazing trick to it, just constant exposure to new things. Once you speak in front of a group once, it's basically the same every time afterwards. Whether it's 10 people or 1000, they're just a bunch of faces. In fact, *all* large stages are equivalent once you have the lights in your eyes and you can't actually see the audience at all. After your 2nd, 3rd, maybe 4th time at something, you'll realise that you've experienced a lot of what it means to do that thing. Know your subject matter, be confident that you can rabble on about something when asked or just admit that you don't know the answer, and let go of worry. You'll start getting better and handling conversations on-the-fly, you'll find ways to interject some laughs into your presentation, and before you know it, people will be saying ""wow, how does someone get so good at that"" *about you*. 

No one is paying attention when you start out. It may be for a debate class, a random presentation, or some obscure speech you've been offered up to give, but if you have no practice with public speaking then it's almost by *definition* that no one will care. My first ever presentation to my department as a freshman was a bit of a shit-show, but my most recent one was a hit. Every time you learn what works and what doesn't, and you develop your own style a little bit more. And if you're still panicked before that big presentation:

 - Don't drink coffee or energy drinks beforehand. Your body will provide you with more than enough adrenaline. Too much, really. 

 - Take a bottle or glass of water with you. Your mouth will get dry whilst talking (and due to nerves), and then it can feel/sound weird when you talk. Others won't really notice, but you will and it'll be off-putting. 

 - If you need to, sprint around the building once or twice beforehand. You're going to need to burn off some energy. Being a bit exhausted is actually good since it'll balance with your nervous energy and make you seem ""relaxed"" and ""calm"" to an audience. 

 - Also, distract yourself beforehand. Try to go first if possible, talk to friends beforehand, or focus intently on other talks if you have to wait. Don't think about yours. There are no good changes you can make right before you speak. Leave improvisation for when you're more comfortable and experienced. 

 - Practice again and again and again. Preferably, see if you can get into your actual lecture hall (or where you're giving the talk) for some practice runs with classmates/friends. Don't make it a super serious practice, and establish beforehand that even word-vomit is fine for a first go. You're there to practice *giving* a talk, getting a feel for the room and your own timing, not to practice being judged. 

 - Change your mindset from ""I'm nervous"" to ""I'm excited"". Those two emotions elicit very similar bodily responses, it's just your interpretation of that feeling that's different. Keep doing that and your brain will slowly learn that talking is *fun*, not *scary*. 

 - For your actual presentation: less is more. Pick out one (max two) key ideas that you want to convey and then structure your presentation around that. Keep visuals simple but engaging too. If you have e.g. powerpoint slides, keep it to <5 bullet points with no more than a sentence in each. Figures and your own speech should provide the rest of the content. 

Edit2: Another key tip for a smooth presentation

 - ""Seed"" in questions that you want people to ask and then have a somewhat prepared answer to those questions. If you're presenting the results for 3 different cases, maybe you only go into depth on 2 of them, leaving the third one as something people can ask about. The more questions you can predict ahead of time, the less you'll have to fumble for an answer on the spot. ",15,213,428.2418319393943,college
"This is it guys, this is my final shot","Hey guys, I just thought I'd get this out there because I wanted some sort of record for myself down to look back at no matter the outcome. Anyway, like the title vuagly suggests, this is my final shot at making it in college. I'm a second semester sophomore studying biochemistry and I've have a fairly tough go so far in ny college career. My GPA is uncomfortably low to a point were I am facing disqualification status on my enrollment at the school unless I'm able to turn this quarter around drastically. I have had mitigating circumstance that have caused some of my issues, which fortunatly my school has recognized and taken into account for giving me another shot at turning everything around, but I cant say that all of it has been out of my control. I need to maintain a B-C+ average through all my classes this quarter to keep afloat and get readmitted come spring quarter, but it's a really tall order considering I've never gotten above a C in my courses yet. I dont beleive I'm incapable or unable to meet my goals, but my track record has said otherwise and adimmitedly puts a pretty big damper on my motivation and confidence moving forward. I have 4 classes this quarter, including a course I need to complete my work for to get a grade from my last quarter. It's an absolute truckload of work, but it's what I need to get back into things. What I have to gain is stability and the ability to continue in school without any worry in my mind, what I have to lose is an incredibly important opportunity in my life due to my own doings and circumstances. Its gut wrenching, and I havent even started taking classes yet. If you guys took the time to read this, thank you for sticking it out.

Hope you guys dodge my situation or similar ones all together, and if you have congratulations on sticking through👍

My uncle died today from cancer and I have a final exam tomorrow.,"My uncle passed today at the age of 55 from esophageal cancer that had spread to his brain. I’m very sad that I never got to say goodbye, but I’m even more sad for his wife, children, and his brothers (including my dad).  

I go to a community college. I have a microbiology final that I’ve been studying for, and I’m almost halfway reviewing through the material when I got the bad news. I’ve been crying on and off all day, so I decided to text my professor to let him know what happened and if he could show any leniency towards taking the exam. I would have came to see him but it was way passed his office hours.  

When I told him what happened the first thing he said was ask me if I would take an incomplete, but I’m not sure why he thought I would want to do that. I have 109% in his class and never missed an assignment or a day of lecture. I’m graduating in 2 days so taking an incomplete isn’t an option. Since my grade is so high, I could get a 0 on the final and still come out of the class with a B. I would prefer an A though, since this class is a prereq to the nursing school I’m looking at.  After I told him that wasn’t an option, I explained that I would take the final but I don’t think I will do very well considering what’s happened and he said “I’m sorry (my name)”. That was the end of the conversation.  

Is this normal behavior for a professor? From the text messages I don’t think he believed me. He didn’t seem very understanding of my situation at all. I know exam time means that many family members “die”, but I’m not making it up. I’ve been an excellent student. I would rather be with my family right now. ",39,206,487.6832439764313,college

"Got 0% on my first calculus exam, should I drop?","I am very angry and upset right now. I feel pretty dumb honestly. What happened is this:
I took a calculus test. I felt decently prepared. while I am not perfect with calculus, I felt confident that I scored at least 70%. When I got my test back, it said 0%. My professor gave out a solution key to every one, and when looking at it I saw that I worked out a lot of the problems very similar
to how he did.

I went to him after class to ask him to look at it and he said he wouldnt have any time until
2pm. At 2pm, I went to his office and he was VERY angry and said he had to eat lunch.

After 40 minutes of waiting outside of his office, I knocked once more to the same response - he said he was eating his lunch and seemed very upset. I apologized nervously (as I 
was looking to get on his good side to look at my test)

When I finally was able to sit with him, he said he didn't have time to look over the whole test, and told me he would only give me points for 2 problems that I felt he made mistakes on. i showed him a problems in which I worked through over half
of the solution correctly, and asked if there was any sort of partial credit. For example, I made a mistake by saying 9x+6 as the answer,instead of -9x+6. He refused to give me any points for anything and told me that I might have to drop the class because of the grade scale.

The grading scale:
3 exams worth 100 pts each, and a final exam worth 200 points.

What do you guys think I should do? I just paid $1,200 tuition for that class alone and I'm so sad and upset that I already failed a test. If I stay in the class I might be stressed as fuck to get all A's the whole time, but if I drop I will be behind on my graduation. 

EDIT: The class average was a 37% for our section.


Update: I went ahead and scheduled an appointment with the head chairman of mathematics of my school. I said down and explained my whole situation as honestly as I could, and showed him my exam and the solution key. He told me that my professor has been teaching for 30 years, but these last few years he's been very well known for these types of complaints from students. He suggested I drop the class and really work on my calculus skills for next semester, and even gave me a lot advice and motivation for moving forward. As for a refund, he said there's nothing he can do because it's up to the registrars office. I read every comment and I appreciate each and every body who left a comment so much. I thank all of you guys for the help and support. You guys really helped me put my foot down and actually talk to someone about this. Bless you guys",90,203,756.2295171245795,college
My college is closing down.,"The President just called all the students into the auditorium and announced it. Just like that. No warning, not even for the faculty and staff. There were prospective students touring campus *this morning*. Students had already been admitted for next year. They hired new faculty for next year. *There was no warning whatsoever*. I'm graduating at the end of the year so I'll be fine but the poor underclassmen have to scramble to get new homes. And all the faculty and staff, many who live on campus now have three months notice to find somewhere else. Whole campus is going to be sold, probably the thousands of acres of beautiful wilderness turned into McMansions or some shit. Fuck.

This school has a $94 million endowment, regional accreditation in good standing, and a 114-year history.

"Six years ago I'd failed out of college twice, my GPA was <2, and I'd only passed ~30% of my classes. On Saturday I received my degree.","I know a lot of people struggle and stress at the end of semesters when they start crunching numbers and see they might fail a class. That *is* something to take seriously and remedy quickly, something I wish I had done, but I wanted to encourage those who are struggling: You can come back from bad grades if you set your mind to it and put in the effort.

You're welcome to AMA about my time before/after the turnaround, but the general summary is that I came to college with no clear goal and *definitely* no work ethic. I chose a major that was somewhat interesting and struggled along. The coursework was easy, but I was just never enthusiastic about showing up to class. A few teachers bought the various sob stories I came up with, but after a few semesters of a clear pattern, no one was listening anymore. I was forced to academically withdraw for a minimum of one year. I did so, and returned promptly, stating in my appeal to be readmitted that I had realized what I had done wrong and was dedicated to fixing the problems.

*Nope.* Same old fuck-up me did it again. After just a few missed classes panic gripped me and I fell into a deep depression. Depression's easy to ignore when you have World of Warcraft.

I was forced to academically withdraw again, and I spent the next few years playing WoW 18 hours a day and losing more and more ground in real life. No job, dead-end relationship, and no prospects to return to school.

I can't say what changed, but one day I realized I wanted and deserved more. Unfortunately nothign had changed yet, but I at least had the common sense to see a school counselor and ask what they recommended. They had me take a series of personality tests, asked me abstract questions about goals I might wish to achieve in life, etc. and matched me to various fields that would work well for my goals and personality. My major (Criminal Justice) was not there, *everything* was saying science and academia, which is terrible because I'm bad at math and science *and* clearly can't handle being a student, let alone a teacher, right?

I still needed a science credit to graduate, though, so I took a Nutrition course. My God the change it created in my life. I realized that dietetics as a field existed and I was off like a shot. I changed my major despite it adding three years to my degree, I had to take lots of remedial math and start from scratch on general science courses. However, this time I had *passion* for what I was doing. I did *so well* in my courses since switching my major that I raised my GPA from a ~1.2 to a 3.2 (not an easy feat when you have nearly 200 credits factored in, a large amount of which are early failures), I studied abroad on scholarship, I had a paid research position, I was a TA for my department, I won various awards for my research, I was chosen as a nutrition-specific Writing Fellow, etc. etc.

#TL;DR: 

**You can come back from hardship.** I know that when you see your grade slipping in a class or you're not getting what you anticipated it can seem like the world is crumbling around you and you can't possibly bounce back, but you *can*. Just find where the problems lie (for me it was lack of passion and a desirable goal, for you it may be something different) and fix those before you spend too much time and money digging yourself deeper into a hole. You can climb out of some surprisingly deep holes, but it will be far easier if you climb out early. ",18,199,1258.8740194393943,college

"Would sending a ""thank you"" to my college's office of financial aid be frowned upon?","I'm currently a rising junior at a liberal arts college that has around 1000 undergraduate students. Students have been receiving their financial aid packages recently, and I was just notified of mine a few days ago. Despite some concern I had about how my income from my previous summer job might impact my financial aid package, I still received a very generous amount from my college. Without the financial aid that my college has offered me over the past three years, I wouldn't have been able to attend college, let alone an out of state institution, without incurring significant financial debt. As such, I feel incredibly grateful and indebted to my college's office of financial and would like to thank them.

&#x200B;

Essentially, my question regarding this situation is whether or not it would be strange to thank them, and what the best way to do so would be if I did thank them. I understand that the people working in the office often receive harsh, critical emails and phone calls from students that do not receive significant financial aid, or are given a reduced financial aid package, and that a happy email expressing gratitude may be welcoming. That being said though, I still have to complete my junior year of classes and wait for my financial aid for my senior year to arrive, and I don't want to appear as though I am trying to influence their next decision. My only intentions would be to express appreciation because they have done a lot in allowing me to attend an institution of higher education, even if their process for allotting financial aid is fairly formulaic.",23,204,84.3736490690239,college

My dad suggested starting a Go-Fund Me for my college tuition. I'm speechless.,"My mom is not involved in my life, and my dad has always been a single parent. He probably makes around 70-80k a year. A few months ago, he had to take out a 20k loan for my younger sister so that she could attend a prestigious beauty school.

For the past 2 years, I've been attending a community college that has been relatively inexpensive. This summer, I got accepted to my dream University. While my dad was excited to hear the news, he was a bit nervous about the cost of tuition. 

He emailed me and suggested we should start a Go-Fund Me account for my tuition. He said we could send it to family and friends, and possibly get donations from strangers. He wants my input on it. Honestly, I'm speechless. I am NOT okay with asking people for money... I would get loans or apply for more scholarships before I ever accepted something like that.

Reddit, I know that college is going to get very expensive for me soon. Are there any things I can do to help get money for tuition, like applying for scholarships? 

UPDATE: Dad decided not to do the Go-Fund Me idea. I still want to look at financial aid options and potential scholarships. Is there anything else I should do? I’m tired of feeling guilty for wanting to go to my dream school.

I'm Feel Unsafe When I Come Out of My Dorm at Night?,"So, I guess it might just be me being one of the stupid freshmen of the campus and thinking everyone's out to get me, but whenever I leave my college dorm at night, there's some guys standing near the elevator that takes you out of the housing area. As I left my room to get over there as there was a college event happening downstairs at the dorms. One of the guys saw me and put his hand into his pants where his crotch is. That was probably just what guys do or something, I guess, and ignored it.

​

After a little bit in the college event, I decided to head back in for the night and told my roommates before going back up through the elevator. When I came back out of the elevator and moved to where my dorm hallway is, there was only one guy there and he slowly went to following me down the hallway, and boy, am I so glad that there are security doors for each hallway with dorms, because I quickly hurried into my dorm's hallway for the night and the guy just sat there when the door closed, cussing out a single word when I head in and hurried into my dorm. I'm believe he was just pretending to be on his phone at the time.

​

Maybe I'm just overreacting and nothing's actually happening. But I would like some advice either way. Should I take this issue to the Security office or just let it slide?

​

***Giant Edit: Okay, so I noticed all the comments I've been getting and honestly, I didn't expect my situation to blow up on reddit like it did. I was expecting maybe 2-3 people to pass on advice to me and nothing more. I didn't expect to come back from a class to see my reddit topic blowing up with over a hundred upvotes and multiple comments telling me what to do. It means a lot guys, thank you. I went to the security office for this issue and should have it looked into to see if it's a case or not.***

***To those that are questioning whether or not if there's security cameras; yes there is. My situation was more than likely caught on camera and I told them the time when it should've occurred as well for me. Unfortunately, I didn't know what the guys looked like and only remembered one of them having shorts or whatever on. I was too busy at the time being paranoid and rushing off back into my dorm.***

***And yes, it could possibly be that I was being just plain paranoid and the guys are innocent. I already took the issue to security however. If they have reasons to be suspicious of them, they'll act on it, but for now, there is nothing else I can do but maybe wait to see if anything comes up. And don't worry, I now know that guys have to readjust themselves at time because well, they have balls and that's uncomfortable at times. The reason it made me uncomfortable was the fact that as soon as he saw me, he went into his pants to grab his crotch. He is NOT the same guy who followed me to my dorm. It was a different guy. The reason that guy made me uncomfortable was the fact he was slowly walking behind me instead of moving up to the door as if he's waiting to be let in. It was in the middle of the night, and I was by myself in that general area with the guy. And as I said, it could be that the guys are innocent and weren't attempting to do anything wrong.***

***And yes, I do have campus security call poles everywhere, but not in the housing itself. I'd have to go down to the office itself to notify them of my problem, and I wasn't willing to turn around and deal with the guy head on if the case turns out to be true of malicious intent. And with the issue of my roommates unfortunately being victims of sexual assault, I had a heavy feeling of foreshadowing over my head since then, so that made my paranoia even worse at the time.***

***Either way, if the guys are truly innocent, then it is the fault of mine and I'd apologize to them if I remembered who they are if security was bad towards them, but if not, well...***

***Thanks once again to everyone that was concerned enough about me to tell me what to do and helped me out. It means a lot, especially to some measly freshman like me who don't know what they really want to do in life, much less how to handle a creepy situation like that.***

I didn't turn in a paper worth 10% of my grade last week and I felt nothing. It wasn't a matter of not knowing I needed to do it. I even liked the topic. I respect my professor and like the class. I just didn't do it. 

I don't know how to get past this apathy. I can't really motivate myself to do much of anything. Even video games are just exhausting. So I just don't want to do anything except sleep. I recognize that this may have consequences in the future and my future self will probably regret it, even if I feel nothing now so I want to see if I can get past it.

I tried seeing a school counselor a few weeks ago but she wasn't very helpful - mostly just dismissive of the feelings I mentioned. I may try to go to the counseling center again but typically they have a 3-4 week wait period especially as we get close to finals, so more immediate suggestions would be helpful.

During the test I only touched it once, which was to move it back in my back pocket because I felt it sliding out. My professor saw me put my phone into my back pocket (didn’t move it anywhere else except INTO my pocket) and when I finished my test she asked me why I was using my phone in the beginning of class. I was so confused when she asked me because I only used it BEFORE class. She mentioned to me she saw me put it in my pocket, which it was already in my pocket to begin with but just sliding out. I remembered and told her that I felt it sliding, I did not use my phone during the test. She told me she believed me and next time there will be consequences, I agreed and thought next time I’ll just put my phone in my backpack. Today, she posted grades from the test, and it appears I have a 0. I showed work for EVERY problem, even the obvious ones. I was one of the last people done.

What should I do? Should I ask an academic advisor for advice before coming to her? What should I expect?

I did everything. He used my data, my graphs and my results. Most importantly though he used my idea. There is a section in the paper that talks about how useful the experiment is because of the novel approach that the study included - and it was all my idea.

10 exam hacks I used to improve my score with less studying,"There were times when I did well in exams not because I had really mastered the subject, but really because I was pretty good at taking exams. I would feel bad about it because I felt I didn’t study as hard and did not ‘deserve’ it. It’s a weird thing to feel but I rationalised to myself that exam technique is a skill after all and I should be rewarded for having it. As much as exams are a gauge of how you well you know the material, exam techniques can push you just that bit further.

Here are some things I did or did not do in every exam to ace it beyond what I should have gotten:

1. I used momentum to my advantage. If there is one thing you should try after reading this article, it is this. Exams are like sprints. To win in a race, you go as fast as you can till you cross the finish line. Speed trumps accuracy (most of the time). What I always do in exams is to speed through the entire paper first. This allows me to check multiple times (4th point). I would take a few seconds to read each question and work on it if I can. If I can’t, I don’t waste more than 30 seconds trying to figure it out. IOW, I only do questions that I am confident in first. This is key for me, as I realised when I tried to work every single question regardless of difficulty, I slow down even at the easy ones. When I stay too long at a question, it only takes the wind out of my sail.

2. I would always do the easiest section first. When you start an exam, you are fresh and ready to go. I hate papers where the first question/section is so hard that it just stops me. So I would ask myself which section has the easiest questions, and work from there. Thankfully, most exams are structured that way, but I don’t let the structure of the paper determine how I attack it.

3. Annotate questions. As I am plowing through the paper, I would mark or annotate questions based on how well I can answer them. I developed a simple system which allowed me to mark down what I knew was definitely correct, which I will review last, questions that I am slightly unsure of, and questions that I cannot do at all. This clear defining allows me to go back and re-do the right questions to ensure my time is best utilised to get the maximum results.

4. I would check my work at least once, usually twice. Because of momentum, I am able to finish my exams usually in half the time given or less. Then I would go back to the questions that I was completely stumped by, which if I can at least try a little, may give me some marks purely based on luck/effort. Then I would look intensely at the questions I have answered but was not 100% on. Finally just a quick glance at what I know for sure is correct.

5. Time management without doubt is key, but I don’t worry too much about it. Sounds weird but hear me out: My rule is simply to do the easiest questions first and blast through the entire paper so I can use momentum and have time to check my answers. Hence I don’t watch the clock when I am doing exams. The only time I break up my time according to the questions is if it comprises of a few long structured or essay questions which may cause me to spend too much time on each question.

6. Confidence. I always believed in myself when it came to exams. This can’t be underrated. I have given tuition to many students who really just think they suck at exams. Imagine, this is how they feel even before they see the paper. No wonder they do badly. I used to have a tuition teacher for math in junior college. He was lazy and didn’t really help me much, but he did give me confidence by continually telling me I will ace the A levels (which I did). I knew he was bullshitting, but it did give me confidence, somehow. I know how useful this is so I always tell myself this silently before I walk into the exam hall: “I’ve studied as hard as everyone here, maybe even more. I deserve to do well. I want to do well. I’m here to kick ass and get 100%”.

7. MCQ tricks. Interesting fact about MCQs: They were invented by a professor in 1914 at the start of the World War I which he described as “…a test of lower order thinking for the lower orders.” So by nature, MCQs should be the easiest form of questions to answer. One easy way to be correct without knowing the material was to strike out those that I knew was wrong for sure, or the elimination technique. That reduces the number of possible options, and improves your chances of being correct by sheer luck.

8. Condition my mind/body. If possible, I would do mock exams at the same time a few days in a row before the exam. It allowed me to get used to working my brain out at that particular time. If I did not have exam papers, I would piece together random questions here and there to form roughly the number of questions and type of questions that would come out.

9. Have enough sleep. This is obvious and goes without saying, but every night before an exam, I would try to sleep 8 hours, which is my ideal time.

10. Caffeine. I used to do this disgusting habit of drinking red bulls for every exam I took to get a sugar/caffeine high. If I could redo university, I would just do a double espresso. Simple and effective, without the crazy amounts of sugar and whatever nonsense that goes into those processed drinks.

Hope it helps someone here :)",40,184,1254.6399800875424,college

10 things I learned during my first semester of college!,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a good break! I just finished my first semester of college and wanted to share few things I personally learned. Hopefully this can help current and future students!

&nbsp;

**1. College is damn expensive**
&nbsp;
College is expensive, and I think everyone knows that. Regardless of whether your parent are paying for them or you're getting a loan, do not waste money by not giving 110% effort. You are there to to learn and succeed, not to go out every night and fail classes. I'm not saying you can't have fun, but make sure you set your priorities straight before it's too late. If you're getting a loan, I think you should sacrifice more 

&nbsp;

**2. Talk to your parents often**
&nbsp;
We are probably all enjoying this newly found freedom in college without our parents being on our ass 24/7. Although this might be nice, you will most likely never see them as often as you did in high school. Always make sure to let them know you love them because soon they might not be here anymore. 

&nbsp;

**3. Hard work will beat intelligence** 
&nbsp;
Some people are naturally smarter, and it really does suck. But don't let this be an excuse to lowering your expectations. I have met so many people who aren't naturally smart but has worked extremely hard to get A's.  Also, if you're smart don't rub it in. It's pretty douchey. 

&nbsp;

**4. Find what studying style works for you**
&nbsp;
Just because your friends study a certain way doesn't mean it will work for you. I wasted the first month of my college frantically taking notes and realized that I'm just spitting the what my professor said onto a paper rather than trying to understand it. And most of them time, the professor will post lecture notes online. Finding what worked for me helped me save a lot of time.

&nbsp;

**5. Don't skip class**
&nbsp;
Like I said, college is expensive. It might not feel like it, but you're wasting so much money every time you're skipping class. Even if you don't think it's helpful, go. Form new relationships and get to know the teacher. Who knows, you might end up needing to ask for letter of recs from the teacher of the class you always skipped. 

&nbsp;

**6. Get out of your room**
&nbsp;
Do not stay in your room all day. There are so many people in college, there is someone who you can connect with. Make some friends. Find a date. Do something other than being in your room all day. It's not healthy and you will regret it. 

&nbsp;

**7. Find some sort of activity that will keep you or get you into shape**
&nbsp;
Exercising is not only good for looking good but it will help you get better grades and stay healthy. Don't let yourself get out of shape because it's hard to get back in. Plus it's not attractive :P. Stay fit. It's good for you.

&nbsp;

**8. Partying/drinking is not ""cool""**
&nbsp;
As everyone probably know, partying and drinking is huge in college. I'm not against them, and I personally think they can be fun. But I do have a problem with how they are praised to be ""cool"". Like some kids think it's ""cool"" to get plastered and black out and puke. They brag to their friends next morning about how ""hard"" they went and people praise them. Honestly, this is not the case. Remember if you're only doing things to look ""cool"", chances are, you're probably not cool lol. Also, everything in moderation. 

&nbsp;

**9. Keep your integrity and don't lose yourself** 
&nbsp;
You will probably change drastically throughout college. I know I did. But make sure you don't lose sight of who you are. Sure you might find new hobbies and interests, but don't be someone who you're not. Don't cheat on homework or test because you didn't study. Don't be an asshole because you think it will make you look cooler. Don't fall under peer pressure. Always make sure you put school on top of the priority list. Just be responsible.  

&nbsp;

**10. Have fun! Socialize! Gain new perspective and learn about new cultures!** 
&nbsp;
These are 4 years of life you will never experience again. If you regret doing or not doing something in high school do it! If you like a guy or a girl, ask her out! Don't be a Pu**y! If you want to be more outgoing, be more outgoing because you are starting fresh. So is everyone else! If you think it's weird to talk to people in class or anywhere, you're wrong. I'm sure you would love if people came to talk to you! Don't only talk to people you are comfortable with. Talk to all kinds of people! It will help you become a more complete person!

&nbsp;

**11. G.P.A. is just a number**
&nbsp;
I'm not saying don't get good grades, but make sure you're not killing yourself over a 4.0. Although a good G.P.A. is helpful, recruiters look at your people skills and experience. I managed to get an internship as a freshmen year  even thought I don't have a college G.P.A. thanks to my ability to talk to people. Become a well rounded person and don't pull hairs for a silly number! (People seem think I'm saying GPA doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You should always aim to have a high GPA. I'm just saying, don't kill yourself because you got a 3.9 over a 4.0.) 

&nbsp;

Thanks for reading guys! I just wanted to share my thoughts about college. This is purely my opinion so please don't think this is what everyone thinks. If you agree or disagree, I would love to talk about them! Feel free to ask any questions! Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I didn't proofread lol.

My professor kicked out 2 students on the first day of class,"My Risk class has maybe about 300 students. On the first day my professor tells us that we can't use our phones during class. That's obvious, I don't think most professor supports the use of phones during class. But obviously most students don't follow those rules. 

About 10 minutes into the class a TA cuts off the professor mid-sentence and yells ""Professor we have a student texting!"" The professor immediately told the student to leave. About 30 seconds of silence goes by and the student doesn't leave. I'm guessing they were embarrassed or in shock of what just happened. The professor then again over the podium says, ""I will not continue my class until you leave my classroom."" The student left shortly after. I looked around the room and realized that there were 6 TAs watching the students like hawks the entire time. After that incident another student was caught maybe 30 minutes later. Same treatment, he was told to leave and was embarrassed by the situation. I understand that phones are annoying, but I've never seen a professor take the phone policy so seriously.

College Majors Megathread!,"Hope everyone is having a fantastic summer.   


  
I have been noticing a lot of questions, particularly from incoming college freshmen, regarding majors they're interested and the pro's and con's between different majors\- or whether 2 majors go together, or if a major/minor goes together, etc.   


I think it is a good idea to have a megathread discussing college majors. Not only will there be people here that will be willing to answer questions based on their own experiences in the major (or what they know about different majors)\- but I hope that people can scroll through and learn information about a variety of different majors. This will hopefully be a good resource! As I graduated with a CS degree I will be more than happy to answer any questions regarding that major. I'm sure some other members of this sub will chime in about their own majors.   


  
Things to do in this thread:   


  
* Ask if you are a right fit for a major   


  
* Ask about pro's and con's between different majors   


* Ask about job outlooks and salaries for different majors 


* Ask about the classes each major typically requires 

* Ask about workloads of majors and people's personal experiences

* Anything related to majors that isn't above! 


Also- feel free to just leave a comment explaining your experience in a particular major! This does not have to be Q&A. Just leave any information that might be helpful to students regarding picking a major.

"Answered exam questions in cursive, professor gave me low score","Need some advice. I have NEVER had any problem with a single professor, I've enjoyed my time in school and have never failed an exam.

However, I just got passed back an exam that I effectively made a 25% on. I was shocked to see that score on Blackbord. Upon further inspection, the majority of answers which were marked wrong were correct. They were worded similarly, if not exactly like my peers who received great marks on the exam, so I approached my professor politely and asked if he could look over my test, there appears to have been a mistake with the grades. He didn't take my exam, instead remarking ""if I can't read it quickly, I'm not going to grade it"" and walked off. We were not allowed to keep the exams, and I feared taking a picture would label me as a cheater.

Here is what my cursive handwriting looked like on the exam. It's not perfect, but I don't believe its illegible:

Should I go into the medical field or be a climate researcher,"Ever since I was little I’ve had a weird fascination with the weather and drastic changes with the earth. I told myself when I grow up I want to be a meteorologist, and still to this day I love learning about the weather, climate change and geological catastrophes. I’m entering my sophomore year at community college and I’m stuck between going into the geosciences or the medical field. My parents are both in the medical field and something about it also interests me. Medicine will always be around and looking at the BLS biomedical (which is a major I’m interested in) the growth rate is outrageous; but for meteorology or climatology the rate barely changes. 
I’m scared that if I get into climate research I won’t have a job in 15-30 years, but if I were to get into medicine there’s always a need for it.

How did you study for the 'harder' subjects in college?,"I'm a freshman in my 2nd semester of Electrical Engineering.

Better sex rules for college,"1) Condoms. Wear them. If someone is refusing to wear one or begging you not to, then don't sleep with them -- they don't care about you. If you've both been tested and you are in a monogamous relationship, and are on proper birth control, then go without them mindfully.

2) Standard STD tests often do not check for herpes I and II and sometimes other STDs, so it's important to ask what you are getting tested for at the clinic. 1 of 5 college students have genital herpes and 80% of them don't have symptoms. Many don't even know.

3) Disclose before having sex. Ask your partner if they have been tested since their last partner. If they say yes, ask them when -- if they can't tell you, they might be lying. If they say no, offer to go with them to get tested, but don't have sex with them until they are tested, even with a condom. If you or your partner has a bacterial STD such as chlamydia, syphilis or gonorrhea, seek treatment before having sex. Tell your partner if you have any viral STDs that you can't get rid of such as HIV, HPV, or HSV. Allow them time to make a decision about whether or not they want to have sex with you. 

4) Passion is easy to get sucked into, so try to have healthily timed interactions with a perspective partner. Go on dates and have fun with a person. Try not to rush things. It's okay to drink, but it spells danger for yourself if you go to a party with every intention to have sex with someone. It's too easy to make mistakes in college, so be as responsible as you can.

5) ""No"" is a complete sentence. It is not rude to refuse sex. Drinking because someone tells you you're a buzzkill will not make them like you more. Do what makes you comfortable, and try to have the foresight to think about situations before you're in them. 

6) Avoid joking about STDs. Chances are, someone in the vicinity had or has one, and you will look ignorant and rude. Remember that gossiping about someone's STD can land you in court. Same goes with sexual assault. Drop the jokes, you're not in high school anymore, and these things are reality, not movie subplots.

7) Foreplay makes sex way better, so warm up yourself and your partner. Females more easily achieve orgasm with foreplay, and males can last longer. This is a great way to bond with your partner and learn what each other like and do not like, as well as explore new things.

I failed all my classes this quarter and I'm ready to just drop out,"Mortuary school is very different, first of all. I'll abbreviate quarters to Q, which is basically a semester. To help y'all understand I'll try to give a brief summary. Quarters 1 & 2 are Gen Ed, I skipped that because I transferred into Q3 with an AA from my undergrad. I was an average student in Q3-5, but Q6 is where it all fell apart for me. I got a job at a funeral home and I love every second of it. The stress, the work, the rush, I love it. I'm all lined up to become an apprentice, which lasts 2 years if you haven't graduated with an AS from mortuary school and 1 year if you have. I failed all of my Q6 classes; I experienced very turbulent burnout, a breakup, and I was focusing more on work. I'm 20 and I've been a full-time college student (undergrad and two semesters in nursing school) since I was 16; I'm so incredibly burnt out. I love my job, I want to be a funeral director, and I have a very deep passion for what I do and I want to have the right credentials. I can retake all the classes I failed in January, then in March I can sit for comprehensive exams before national and state boards. Thinking about it makes me sick. I know I should just bite the bullet and retake the classes, but mortuary school before I got my job was hell on earth for me. Even after getting my job, just walking into the school building and spending the school day at my desk gave me such bad anxiety and i'm already on a fuckload of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds. I know that funeral directing is the career path for me; I wish my grades weren't what people focused on when gauging how passionate and motivated I am to be successful in the funeral industry.

I guess what I'm asking for is support. Has anyone out there bounced back successfully from burnout and failure?

How can I show people that my grades aren't indicative of my work ethic at my job?

I can tell my parents and loved ones are a little disappointed that I failed so much. How do I address that?

First Generation Problems,"Everyone likes to talk about how hard being in college is as a first generation student- and it is- but no one talks about how fucking hard it is to go home.

You stop fitting in with your family. You change and they don't. The way you talk about things, the places you go, and things you know are all different. My family doesn't even listen to me anymore, as I only have ""college ideas""

What does that even mean?? I am the same person I was before I left, and believe the same things, i can just articulate it better. But why does it matter if i'm basically barred from conversation? if now i'm annoying to the people around me. 

I want to share everything I learned! I want to connect with my family, I want them to be proud of everything I've accomplished.  It's not like i am lecturing them or correcting them, I'm just talking about things I've done or experiences I had in college like a normal person. But the more I learn, the more I go to school, the further we drift apart. 

I'm not sure why I didn't see this coming. They were confused why I went to college. They didn't understand why I chose Economics. They don't get why I do internships and volunteer and travel. They weren't even proud that I've made deans list every semester.

My dorm hall is now a war zone,"Tl;dr at end.
 
I remember the night it began. I was on my xbox just chilling for the night. Then suddenly the room burst into chaos. Finger guns pointed in every direction as men breached the door. Shouts told me to put my hands up, which I complied to. However, it was in vain, as I was finger banged  ( ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) moments later. 

My dormies had united into a squad, breaching into rooms and annihilating those inside for ""America, Motherfucker.""

The next night the tactical shenanigans continued. Many were banged. Until the RA on the floor above told them to be quiet. I thought this to be the end. But this was the beginning of an escalation

The introduction of two Nerf pistols caused the dormies to no longer breach rooms but attack each other. This escalated until all of the dormies had intimidating Nerf rifles. Nerf rifles so strong that they might actually sting for a second.

Being a ""civilian"" in this chaos makes it dangerous to complete once simple tasks. I once walked in between a standoff and was quickly (and voluntarily) used as a human shield. Just now, a squadron of dormies had blocked off all entrances to the floor's kitchenette, as two other squads attempted to breach. I forced my way in, which resulted in the annihilation of all inside. I then quickly fled to the room where my Xbox was, where it all began. I thought to myself ""My God... It took me five minutes to wash a damn tea spoon.""

Tl;dr: Dormies began SWATting rooms with finger guns. They got Nerf guns and fought each other. Now takes me five minutes to wash a spoon.

Looking for some insight from peers who have been in college longer than four years,"I’ve been in college for 7 years.

However, I’m still considered a student at the school and was suggested to change my major.

It's the end of the third week of school and I had to skip (I'm allowed one test skip in this class) the first exam of the semester, which also looked like it was going to be the easiest of the semester. It was hard for me to do, but I had transferring trouble that caused me to be late to add classes, and extremely increased pressure from homework. Despite the little material there was, I only learned about this exam date the day before and was unprepared. I'm stressing out a lot right now because of it, it was a hard decision to make.

This is a classic pyramid scheme example. There is no salary and all of your money comes from commission. You have to put a lot of your own money in up front and the way the cards are stacked against you, you will not make a profit. You will be charged various fees (office fees, licensing fees, material fees etc...) and they will suck money right out of you. 

So, I sent the guy a reply to let him know this wasn't the place for me (He said his name was Ryan, but his email was james...@indeed) :

Hi Ryan,

Can I call you Ryan? Your e-mail says James so I'm not really sure who I am speaking to here. Anyway, thank you for thinking of me as someone that you can potentially make a decent profit from. Unfortunately, this just doesn't seem like the right pyramid scheme for me. It's not you guys, it's me. If someone is going to drain money out of me like a leech, I at least prefer it to be a company in my field. That way when I am paying you various licensing fees, office fees, etc... I can at least feel like it will be advancing me in my career path (I hope there is e-mail fee for communicating with you). Thank you for your time and have a pleasant day.

Regards,
Andrew

P.S. You guys should probably try a different lead. There is nothing about my resume that jumps out at someone and says, ""Hey, this guy can be a financial adviser."" I'd recommend a new approach, at least something that may convince the SEC to not shut you down.

Anyone here have a classmate that you can't help but cringe at?,"Goddamn fellas, in my one CompSci class, there's this particular guy that has absolutely zero self-awareness. He could be autistic, but Jesus it hurts when he gets going.

He enjoys ""challenging the professor"" about the example code, and even condescends towards him about the stupidest shit. He's also awkwardly vocal (somewhat quiet, like muttering) whenever someone asks a question that he deems silly or dumb. He did that to me the other day, and it pissed me off.

For instance, the professor uploaded code for us to study that had some exceptions getting thrown. He did that on purpose, so that we can understand interaction between methods, default parameters, optional parameters, references, etc. A simple typing of the word ""ref"" can clear the exception.

But no, after I ask the professor if he would upload today's lecture's example code, this uppity guy then says ""Will the code actually work this time, professor?"" with the most smug expression. He then starts going on about how the code is broken or something. Then the professor professionally explains and shows how it's fully functional (more or less telling him to STFU in a polite way). Then, the cringey guy says ""Yeah, well, that's not what I asked about, but whatever"", which prompted the professor to again demonstrate that the code works in full capacity, and the a simple commented-out line allowed for debugging.

Sheesh, I can't stand that guy. Anyone out there feel me?",54,163,375.376947680135,college
In the mind of a professor.,"I'm a professor getting ready for the new school year. These are the 10 things I wish college students knew.

1. If you plan on skipping class because you are ""sick"" you probably shouldn't write a status update involving how you have a hangover. We don't count hangovers as being sick. When you have class the next day we count them as stupid. Same goes for incriminating pics. Also, don't come to campus intoxicated. If you aren't responsible enough to come to class sober, then you are likely too irresponsible to be in college. 

2. If you want to skip class, I won't stop you. You paid in advance $20+ for each lecture I give you. If you take out student loans to pay for classes you don't attend and are a chronic absentee, you are likely doing poorly in class. You are literally paying money to flunk school. Save your money; don't go to college if you won't go to class.   

3. If you are having trouble in class, come see me. I don't mind. In fact, the university requires I have at minimum number of hours to wait on you every week in my office. I'm not even doing you a favor, it's a part of my job description. Keep me company and ask me questions. It is usually good for your grade. If your prof/TA won't do this, talk to their boss. 

4. It takes me MUCH longer to grade F papers than A papers. If you're failing because you aren't trying, I'd prefer it if you just didn't turn in anything. It will save us both a lot of time, and you a lot of money. Also, I WILL get pissed off if I can tell I spent more time grading your paper than you took to write it. 

5. Over half of freshmen flunk out. You will find yourself up a creek if you have to pay back loans and you have no degree. You will be eligible for the same jobs you had in high school but now have a considerable monthly payment. You are literally worse off than if you just stayed at the burger joint. If you aren't sure you want to do college, check out programs at tech schools. You will get a job much sooner for much cheaper and you will likely make as much money as many 4 year degree holders. 

6. If something major and detrimental happens in your life, let me know. You don't have to tell me details if you aren't comfortable, but I'll be in a better position to give you an incomplete for the term, let you make up an assignment, etc... I will bend my own rules for you. I'm allowed. They're my rules. I bend them for students who need it.

7. Listen to advice from people who know what they are talking about. If you have a 2.5 GPA and are pre-med, your advisor will tell you to have a solid plan B. Have one. They are telling you that because they know you stand a minuscule chance of getting into that program/job/etc...  

8. Make use of your campus facilities. Your tuition money goes to pay for things like tutoring centers, health clinics, gym facilities, concerts, and cultural centers. You don't have to use all of them, but use some of them. You paid for it, and you may find them helpful or fun. 

9. Don't talk about your professors to other students. Every single semester I get a very loyal student who rats out a classmate for talking about me. Loyal students who like professors get REALLY upset when they hear trash talk. I won't grade you harder, but when you ask for a letter or recommendation, I will tell you no and you will have a very awkward conversation with me about your comments.

10. As a grad student I took out $11K in student loans when interest rates were really low. My monthly payment was $85. Many of you will take out $40-200K for your bachelors education. Your payments every month will be higher than what you spend on your car, or even your apartment. To minimize costs, take as many classes a semester as you can while maintaining your grades. Don't get below a C in class. Follow what your advisor says so you don't end up taking classes you don't need. Don't transfer schools if you can help it, unless it will save you a lot of money (you almost always lose classes you took when transferring). Get tutoring if you need it. If you advisor sucks, get another one. Know the course catalog for your major so you aren't relying on someone else to tell you what to take. Pay for as much of your tuition upfront as you can. 

That's about it. Hope everyone has a great fall term!",62,165,2273.06494536532,college

A note for all the soon-to-be freshman.,"I've seen way too many stories on this sub, and heard way too many in real life, of people getting overwhelmed by school for silly reasons. So here's my advice:

1) **Get Organized**. Buy a planner before you start school. When you get your syllabus for a class, *write the entire thing in your planner*. Every date, every assignment, every project. It is a life saver and will keep you from feeling disorganized.


2) **Designate study time**. In school, I had (have) 8 hours of classes every day of the week, every year. At the end of my day, I would sit in the library or a coffee shop, look at my planner, decide what needed to be done that day, and write it down. Write it down to the minute if you have to. Even if you think you don't have anything due the next day, sit down and get organized anyway. Every single day.


3) **Don't waste your own time**. You might have a paper assigned a month in advance. If you have all the resources necessary to complete the assignment, **do it as soon as you can**. One of my classes had a term paper every semester. I would spend a sunday collecting resources, writing an outline, and pounding that thing out, almost four weeks in advance. Then I could come back to it later to revise, edit, etc. It will make your life easy, I promise. Even the toughest assignments can be drafted in a day, or even a few hours. Some of my peers brag about staying up all night the night before this thing is due, and they sound like idiots. Don't be an like them.

Some other small things...

* Buy the APA style guide. Professionalism is everything.

* Get a tutor if you need one.

* Scan handouts from your classes and organize them to use in the future.

* Keep all major assignments somewhere you can get to them easily.

* Talk to and email your professors.

* Don't buy books until syllabus week.

* Check your email. Check your email. Check your email.

* Check Blackboard or equivalent.

* Don't make excuses.


If you can't concentrate, get it out of your system. Take a nap, see a movie, go get lunch. It's not worth the stress of trying to work if you just can't do it right that second. Taking breaks is okay. If you do these things, you'll succeed plain and simple.",57,168,1214.0564268468017,college

Is it common for lecturers to simply power through slides?,"I don't really know If It's due to my mental ability, how the lecturer carries out the lecture or some measure of both, but my brain feels empty after leaving each class.

Computer Science is definitely a difficult subject, but my lecturer generally powers through the slides at an unnecessarily quick pace, throws terms up on the screen that she hasn't introduced, and by the time I think she might explain it, she powers on to the next slide.

She often describes things far too generally giving no specific details and condenses information by abstracting fairly important/rewarding examples and details for greater and easier explanation. I end up coming to lectures only to get the gist of the material I need to cover and look for other sources through the internet to have it explained to an appropriate level.

I have mixed feelings of frustration because the pace I'm learning at is remarkably long (which is fine in general, but the compromises on my social life is taking a slow toll), and confusion because I'm contemplating whether CS is a good fit. Is it just me, or is this a theme at universities?

Edit: I generally do a lot of outside reading for class and curiosity, but since the lecture aspect wasn't a common concern among my peers, I was curious whether It was me being in the minority. The replies have given pretty great insight on that, thanks.",16,159,177.5302694393943,college

PSA for anyone who is at community college or dropped out of high school...NEVER GIVE UP!,"I was a high school dropout. Told I'd never amount to anything. Told I was a loser. Told I was simply lazy. And for a while, I believed it. But you know what? I never gave up. I got my GED, much to my chagrin at the time, and enrolled at my local community college. My first semester there, I figured I'd try my best and maybe one day end up at a 4 year school. I was pretty much going through the motions at that point of my life, not really caring whether or not I failed. But then something happened. About midway through my first semester, I simply said SCREW IT. I'm gonna work my ass off. I'm gonna be the best student in every class, I'm gonna take everything seriously, I'm gonna stop messing around with my buddies every weekend. I decided to really commit to it. 2 semesters in, I decided to transfer to a 4 year college with a decent reputation, not my dream school by any means, but a place I could commute to easily and advance in my educational pursuits. At this University (a place with a 93 percent acceptance rate, for comparison), I continued to bust my ass for another semester. Having 42 credits with a 4.0 as of current date, the decision was easy...apply to my dream school and hope my 57 credits at the end of Fall 2016 would be enough. And you know what? IT WAS! I got accepted to the University of Pittsburgh and I have never been happier. The dream I had for my entire life has been fulfilled. 






The point of this post is that if I can overcome the ""high school dropout-college success"" dichotomy, ANYBODY can. You have to put the doubts, frustrations, and fears out of your mind. Your life can change in as little as a split second. Work hard, handle your business, get rid of anything detrimental to you, and get it done. There will be hard times. Hell, you might even mess up on a test or two. All those mini setbacks will pale in comparison to the pure joy you'll feel when you accomplish your goals. 




If anybody has any questions or just needs a pick-me-up, don't hesitate to ask. I figured I'd post this for anyone who is going through problems with their post-high-school life.

"Yes, you can come back from a rough semester - a story.","Hi /r/college. Thought I would share a little tale of my past year and a half (ok and maybe brag a little)

Most of you might have just gotten your grades, and a few of you aren't going to be happy. My 1st semester freshman year, I was doing ok - I started volunteering on campus, was taking 14 credits, making some friends - life was good. Ended up with a 3.2 gpa - ok, but not wonderful. I was happy enough, since it was my first time taking college classes and I was taking a somewhat difficult major (Bio). 2nd semester, however, was not very good. Goofed off way too much, spent too much time hanging out/procrastinating/drinking & smoking/whatever, didn't care about my classes too much, and...my grades showed that. With a D and two Cs, my gpa was 2.4, making my over a 2.71. Now as someone who aspired to go to some sort of grad school, this was devastating. I lost a scholarship that I needed to afford school. I was freaking out. My schedule next semester wasn't going to be much easier - statistics and Orgo 1 were staring me in the face.

But I fuckin did it. I studied hard, I slowed down on my volunteering (which I was doing too much of), and I made sure that my priority was my academics. I finished with a 3.6, making my overall a 3.02 (even got an A in orgo!!) I'm now eligible to reapply for my scholarship (which the advisor said I'm almost guaranteed to get back) and I'm feeling a lot more confident in my studies. So yes,  it IS  possible. Don't let one rough semester hold you back.

List of Scholarships I Don't Need Anymore (x-post with /r/Scholarships),"I was originally going to go to a very pricy school so I resorted to scholarships to help. But, after much effort, I've chosen to just attend community college for two years to bring up my grades then reapply.

I hope this helps you guys out. It had taken me weeks to put this together.

The eligibility requirements for all of these mainly are:

* You don't need to be a citizen or lawful resident to apply 

* These apply to mostly four-year universities (some two-year)

* The school must be accredited (basically means an ""official school"")

Best of luck. To everyone.

Advice for College First-Years,"I wrote this a while ago, intending it to send it to someone. Unfortunately, we despise each other now. But I didn’t want to waste this so I’m posting it here.

BOOKS:

Books in university are a massive money pit. I’ve heard of people spending close to a thousand on supplies and materials per semester. The reason being is that these books are extremely price gouging. New books typically cost upwards $100. What typically happens is that schools will attach an access code to the book where you will do your homework online. These access codes will cost between $50 and $120 in my experience. 

Suppose you go to the school’s book store and buy a new textbook and the access code. For some, it’d be easier to explain with the tangible example of my Gen. Chem 1 class. At my school, the textbook and the access code together were $300 new. I only paid $100. How? I bought an older edition of the book for $20 on Amazon and then went online and bought the access code from the site directly for $80. A really big price-gouging method that I’ve noticed is that schools will cut a book in half and sell them separately to two different classes. The first half of my $20 older and used book was completely identical the new textbook used in my Gen. Chem 1 class. The second half was completely identical to the Gen. Chem 2 class’s text book.

For classes like biology and chemistry, you’ll also need to buy supplies. Such as lab coats, goggles, etc. At the book store, you’ll find that they are extremely expensive here as well. You can spend $20 on goggles when you can spend far less at an equipment/tool store nearby. I saved almost a hundred dollars doing this.

Absolutely do not buy your books before class starts unless your professor has told you to buy these books and have them ready before class. What typically happens is that the first day of classes, the professor will go over the syllabus, then if there’s any time left they will start a lecture. However, you will not need a textbook for this. The professor will inform you of what you will need for the course, so you should buy the materials when you know you need them. If you run around buying textbooks from older students, you will get price-gouged. A student can sell you a $120 Physics textbook and tell you that he spent $200, but in reality, there’s an $80 access code that you will need to buy later.

If you like PDFs, pirate your books. I probably can’t link sites here, but you can find them fairly easily. 

CLASSES:

Do your research. Is this going to be a hard class? Is this class going to have a high workload? How much extra credit will be given out in this class? Will your grades be mostly determined by homework or tests? Most of this you can find through the syllabus. You can also ask older students for advice on the classes. If you plan on dorming, this can be quite easy. If you take some STEM classes like Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry, you’ll find that plenty of students will have taken those classes you’ve taken already and can give you advice. 

Build a study habit. Even if it seems too easy to study for. Build your studying habit. You do not want to get into more difficult and complex classes with the same “oh this is easy, I don’t really need to study. I can go goof off!” attitude. And if you do reach those classes with that attitude, it is very hard to break. So start early, begin studying. Build your discipline.

One thing that people don’t typically take advantage of are office hours. Got a question? Go office hours or email the professor. One very important advice is to go to office hours if you’re majoring in the department that the professor is in. By going to office hours consistently, the professor gets to know who you are. Talk to them about their research. And if you’re in the same department, that is a massive bonus because if the professor likes you, you can use him/her as a reference or letter of recommendation to a program or job.

CAREER:

Building off of office hours, you should be looking at internships in the field you want to go to. Ask your professors if they know of any reputable internships around. If you share an amicable relationship with your professor, you can ask him/her to write a letter of recommendation or refer you to the program.

The internship will help you figure out if you actually want to continue in this field. I did an internship and realized that what I wanted wasn’t actually the complex and abstract but rather the practical applications. And so I changed my major from Physics to Computer Science.

Should you get into the internship, try to keep an amicable and competent relationship with your supervisor. Your supervisor will now serve to be an effective and very important reference in the future. Not only that, the people you meet will be apart of your network. You can ask these people for job opportunities in the future or as references to other jobs.

Apply to scholarships, as many as you can. Take the time to write essays that sell yourself (not literally) to the scholarship. You’re essentially taking an hour out of your day to apply to some scholarships that may or may not make you anywhere upward a few hundred dollars.

Figure out if you plan on going into a graduate program. Build your extracurricular classes to fit into those. Are you certain that you’ll get into this one program? Well fuck you because there’s no guarantee you’ll get into that one. Go apply to other programs and look at their requirements. The sooner you do, the more prepared you will be. Study for the exam you’ll need whether it be the MCAT or GRE or whatever.

My dad died right before midterms. Am I completely screwed this semester?,"Hi reddit. Here's my situation:

Currently 21 years of age and in my 4th year of college. I am aiming to complete my B.S. in Computer Science in the spring  of 2020; and afterward aiming to get into a MS program in data science. College has not been easy on me. I graduated high school in 2015 5th in my class and with nearly 60 college credits due to a vigorous dual-enrollment program I was in my jr and sr years. I thought I was hot shit coming into University, but was very quickly knocked off my high horse. It took me nearly 2 years to figure out what I wanted to major in (from poli sci, to biochem, to finally computer science/ data science). I did not adjust very well in a dorm setting while being 5 hours away from home. I already have had to take a medical withdraw one semester (due to being hospitalized twice- for 2 weeks out of a month for being unable to manage my anxiety and OCD). Needless to say my entire adult life thus far has been one challenge after another both academically and personally.

Fast forward to this semester. I was doing fantastic in all of my classes while working 32 hours a week. I had achieved high 90s on all my mathematics and CS tests thus far. My only hurdle seemed to by physics- my Achilles heel. I'd been putting off taking physics for years as it has always been my weakest subject. But alas, I was maintaining a low to mid-B average, which was completely fine with me (I'm the type of person who only considers myself doing well if I'm maintaining all A's). The week before midterms, I was informed my father was one of a fatalities of Hurricane Michael. 

Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention- I moved across the country last year to complete school and live with one of my best friends and their family. I was 2,300 miles away from my family when I heard this news.

As anyone would do, I quickly booked a flight to Virginia for 2 days later. I was beside myself. This was the first major loss I'd ever experienced in my life, and it hurt much more to know it had happened in such a tragic and violent manner. My 18 year old sister and I were also tasked with managing his final affairs, as my parents divorced when we were 8 and 4. The past 2 weeks have been absolute hell. I have gone through so much more heartache, emotional and mental stress, as well as all the physical symptoms that can accompany grief, than I ever thought one person could take. On top of that, I'm also trying to orchestrate a contest of my father's will, as he wrote my sister and I out of it just months after my parent's divorce, obviously out of spite for my mother, and never thought to change it, as of course no one ever thinks they'll be taken so suddenly. Before finding the will, the court appointed us administrators of his estate; and we've been told now that that cannot be changed. So we now have to perform those duties with a $100,000 bond over our heads and we will never see a penny of the assets we help collect (which, of course, obviously doesn't mean more to me than the loss of our dad, but it would definitely give my sister a great start in life and would help me pay off most of my medical/student debt). 

Now that I'm back home from being in VA, I'm trying to catch up with my studies. I missed 2 midterms along with many, many important lectures. My physics midterm is tomorrow, and I've been so distraught and still reeling from all the stress I have hardly been able to study for it. I could withdraw, but if I do that I don't think I'll be able to graduate on time. I guess I'm just writing this post to ask for advice. I'm sort of at my wits end. My anxiety is rampant again, I can't sleep because my father's death keeps replaying over and over continuously in my head, each time more graphic and violent than the last. It's as if the universe keeps trying to tell me that college isn't the right path for me, but I just don't want to listen to it.

Sorry for the novel, I just really needed to lay everything out. Thanks all in advance for any advice you may provide.

Why so many failing students?,"One after another, students seek advise after failing college. I give those students kudos for seeking advice, but what is behind the failing? I am not pointing fingers, simply looking for reasons. Could it be the students weren't ready to attend college? Could they have not taken it serious enough? Could college simply not be for them? Certainly any of these could apply, but I have to ask how much of a factor is due to secondary education failing the students? Now before teachers start taking me to task, it is the system and lack of resources I question. Sure, there are some bad teachers. There are bad in any given group. As a whole, I don't think teachers have degraded, but the curriculum, responsibilities and lack of virtually everything they are confronted with. Why are other countries so far ahead of us. Are you old enough to remember when other countries used to look up at us? It is a fact that when you tear something apart like lowering standards, which you can do with the flick of a pen, take generations to undo. Do we have the time to waste? Not by judging the current state of the country.",170,152,508.2946675875424,college

Feeling lonely,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this

It's a Friday night and I'm in my bedroom crying because I can hear people outside and at bars while I'm here. I live in a lively area, full of students. I'm one of those people who never goes out during the weekends and I feel absolutely shitty about it. I'm pretty social during the week and even some weeknights, but the fact that I don't do anything during weekend nights is really bothering me. I don't have any close friends, and I'm not very good friends with my roommates either, so I wouldn't even know where I'd go and who I'd go with.

I know there's people who are perfectly content with staying in on the weekends, and I wish I was too. I'm always comparing myself to everyone else when it comes to my social life, and even though I have people to talk to in class and outside, I hate that I don't have super close friends, or that I don't go out at night. I don't even like going to bars (not interested in drinking), and I've never been to a party. I wish I'd stop comparing myself and be happy with how far I've come on my own. I'm proud of what I've accomplished in every other aspect, but in terms of night life and being social when *almost every other college student is*, I feel like I'm just lame for staying in and missing out on the ""fun"". 

How do I make this feeling go away? It really sucks not having anyone close to talk to, and spending my Friday crying because I'm not outside like everyone else is.

Edit: to clarify what I mean by being social during the week - I'm finally involved in some different clubs that revolve around my interests, and I've made acquaintances in class that I talk to most days. Unfortunately, every acquaintance I've made in class has stayed one, no matter my efforts in trying to become friends.",52,150,31.07022314309798,college
Difference in difficulty for Community College courses and University courses?,"So I am graduating this term with my associate from a community college and will be starting at a university in the fall. My father loves to say how now I am starting ""real college"" and going on and on about how much more difficult it will be. Now I know that it will be somewhat more difficult (especially going from 12 credits a term to 18) and that there will be a different less laid back academic mentality, but a part of me really thinks he is just laying the ""back in my day"" on thick.

Taking 2 W’s vs failing a class,"Hi! I’m currently a Junior Computer Science Major going to college at Georgia College. 

My GPA thus far is about a 3.7 and I’ve consistently been getting A’s and B’s and have a pretty strong resumé. There’s only one problem and a single required class that’s been holding me back recently...Calculus 🙃 Last year I tried calculus and came close to failing, so I took a W in the class (dropped without penalty). Now, I’m attempting it again, and I’m pretty close to failing once again. So my question is, what would look worse on my transcript: Taking another W and theoretically doing well next semester or grinding the class and either failing or getting a D? Calculus is the only class I’ve dropped until now, so I’d have two W’s both in Calc if I dropped it again",2,2,0.06470273351503743,college

I feel like I’ve been socially blacklisted because people misunderstand my political beliefs,"I’m a left-leaning centrist at a very left-leaning college in Maryland of about 1,200 students. It’s the kind of university that places social justice at the forefront of all academics, is extremely progressive, and favors nearly every socialist solution to today’s problem. It’s totally fine if people believe that. Not only do most of my friends hold these beliefs, I do (to an extent), as well. 


In my opinion, the problem comes when people here (who largely think the same due to the school’s small size) over-generalize a topic/ group of people and/or they don’t take the subject’s nuances into consideration. I completely disagree with blanket solutions and generalizations. I hate it when people say, “x group only consists of socialists,” or “y group only consists of racists.” Politics isn’t black or white—it’s grey. 


I try my hardest to question the applicability/validity of most generalizations and proposed solutions, in addition to understanding right-wing talking-points beyond a surface-level. As a result, I often find myself being the devil’s advocate, poking holes in people’s argument, and/or defending a group of people from over-generalized labels. 


While professors frequently tell me how much they enjoy hearing my opinions (even if I am only playing a devil’s advocate), I know most students really dislike it. And since word of mouth spreads quickly here due to the school’s small size, I believe most students don’t associate with me because they think I’m this horrible person.  For example, I’ve had some of my PoC friends tell me they were told by other PoC students not to talk to me because I’m “a racist fascist” (I’m not at all btw) 


It seems like I’m in a constant up-hill battle to make friends. Nearly no one understands me, and I’m frequently feel isolated and lonely. I just don’t know what to do.

"Studied my ass off for an exam, felt confident, ended up getting a 70%","So this was my third physics test of the semester. Somehow I got B’s the first two tests despite not really studying and kinda just winging it. This time I decided to actually get my shit together and really study. I told myself I was gonna get an A on this 3rd test. So I studied my ass off, watched 5 hours worth of The Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube, did all of the assigned practice problems, and felt like I had it down. I take the test and the questions are way harder than the practice problems. I had no idea how to do most of them. Ended up getting a 70% despite studying way harder than the first two exams. To make matters worse, my classmates got A’s on the test but agreed that it was really difficult. And yes, I did study with them prior to the test too. We met up outside of school and worked on problems together and I really felt like I had it all down. So how the hell did I manage to do so bad but yet get by with B’s on the other two tests by not really studying? I’m so frustrated, confused, and upset. I know this isn’t the right thing to do but I kinda want to just give up at this point and change my whole major.

Professor cant teach and exam is tomorrow.,"So I'm a student at the University of Texas at Arlington. I'm studying industrial engineering there. A lot of professors here tend to lack the ability to teach a class which really frustrates me and makes me hate the university.

Here is the scenario. The professor gives us PDF power points to look at for class. There are four chapters of power points and each are like 100-200 slides long. The class is nearly 3 hours long one day a week and for 90% of the class all she does is read off powerpoints and then for exam review he just tells us what to look at to prepare for tests. As she would tell us what to look for to prepare for the exam I try to write the information down. I have spoken to other students and they told me she is easy and her exams have no trick questions.

No idea how to study in a class,"Hey Reddit, so long story short I’m taking this history class that I find very difficult due to the professors teaching style.
